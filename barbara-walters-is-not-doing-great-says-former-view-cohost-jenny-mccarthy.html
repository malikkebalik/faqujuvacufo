I really soaked in as much as I could of her, like, skill set, tools, tips. I listened, took notes. So that was the best.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Barbara-Walters.jpg><p>Jenny and Barbara, however, had an up-and-down relationship in the year they worked together. The radio host once opened up and revealed that the&nbsp;Audition author <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wasn’t ready to retire</a> from the show she created. “Imagine a woman like Barbara Walters. It’s her last year and she doesn’t want to leave. Think about that. And I’m the new b–ch there,” Jenny told Ramin Setoodeh for his book, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Ladies Who Punch: The Explosive Inside Story of The View</a>.</p><p>“Every day I went home and I was miserable,” she continued, regretting not jumping at an offer to host her own program. “It really was the most miserable I’ve been on a job in my 25 years of show business. I kicked myself for not taking the CBS job, of course.” Although, Jenny did admit that she still has plenty of love for Barbara.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/barbara-walters-health-update-4.jpg><p>“Look at what Barbara did to me. I had zero hard feelings,” she said. “I loved her like a grandma. She didn’t know any better.”</p><p>While the pair had a rollercoaster work relationship, it is nice knowing that Jenny is still there for Barbara during what seems like a tough time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46bmKuakaeubsPApaueqqNitaaty62fZqKVo7u6ecycmpqqpJ3GbrPIr5ysZaWlsaLAxGamp2WapMKzusCloKysXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./celebrities-most-tone-deaf-reactions-to-the-global-health-scare.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Celebrities' Most Tone-Deaf Reactions To The Global Health Scare</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-incident-that-led-fans-to-believe-nene-leakes-was-being-phased-out-of-the-show.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Incident That Led Fans To Believe Nene Leakes Was Being Phased Out Of The Show</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kristen-welker-and-john-hughes-still-together-updates.html>Are Kristen Welker and John Hughes Still Together?
