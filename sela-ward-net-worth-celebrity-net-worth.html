However, money was tight, and she soon found herself turning to modeling in order to pay her bills. This then led to further opportunities, with Ward being recruited by a notable agency and appearing in a number of television commercials during this period. One of her first major commercials was with the cosmetic brand Maybelline.</p><p>Eventually, Ward read the writing on the wall and relocated to California to pursue a career as an actress. She first teamed up with <a href=# title="Burt Reynolds Net Worth">Burt Reynolds</a>, appearing in the 1983 movie "The Man Who Loved Women." This soon led to her first TV role in "Emerald Point N.A.S.," although this series was short-lived. Throughout the 80s, Sela continued to book a number of roles in TV and film projects, including the <a href=# title="Tom Hanks Net Worth">Tom Hanks</a> film "Nothing in Common."</p><p>However, it wasn't until 1991 that she truly broke through with her role in "Sisters."

This caused her to create a new documentary called "The Changing Face of Beauty," which focuses on Hollywood's obsession with youthful women. However, ward still managed to book a number of notable roles in many other movies throughout the late 90s, including "My Fellow Americans" and "Runaway Bride."</p><p>She also appeared in a vast number of TV series during this period, including "Frasier." In addition, Ward explored voice acting opportunities in animated series such as "The New Batman Adventures." In the early 2000s, she earned critical acclaim for her role in the series "Once and Again," appearing in 63 episodes before the series ended in 2002. Over the next few years, Ward would appear in shows like "House," "CSI: NY," "Graves," "Westworld," and "FBI."</p><p>The early 2000s also saw her book additional film roles in movies like "The Badge" and "The Day After Tomorrow." Over the next 20 years, she would appear in films such as "The Guardian," "The Stepfather," "Gone Girl," and "Independence Day: Resurgence." During this period, Ward was offered a number of additional roles, but she turned them down due to her family commitments. In 2002, she published a book entitled "Homesick: A Memoir." This autobiography details her experiences with fame and the entertainment industry.</p><h2 id=relationships><strong>Relationships</strong></h2><p>In 1992, Sela married entrepreneur Howard Sherman.

With 14,000 square feet of living space, the residence also lies on a plot of land that spans 8 acres. Ward and Sherman renovated the property extensively after their initial 2003 purchase, which might explain the dramatic price increase over the course of about 10 years.</p><p>Features include an infinity pool, 100-year-old flooring, a bar, and French doors. The home was originally built in the 1940s, and it now boasts a 30-person theatre, a putting green, a private lake with its own beach, and an outdoor kitchen complete with a pizza oven.
