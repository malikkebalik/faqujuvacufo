One of them involves the film’s ending, which either involves <a href=#>Rose</a> dying and seeing Jack in heaven or dreaming about Jack. Here’s what <a href=#>James Cameron</a> said about the ending — and a detail in the film which could provide a clue as to its proper interpretation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/titanic.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What James Cameron said to people in the film industry about the end of ‘Titanic’</h2><p id=par-2_65>Firstly, some background. Titanic ends with the aged Rose in bed. We then see her with her eyes closed and cut to a scene where she is on the RMS Titanic, surrounded by the passengers — including her beloved Jack. It’s unclear in the film if Rose is in bed dreaming of Jack or if she went to heaven to be reunited with him.</p><p id=par-3_71>Cameron wrote in <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a> the ending was designed to be ambiguous. He said film executive Sherry Lansing “was a big fan of the slightly enigmatic ending, as I recall. Was old Rose still alive and dreaming of Jack, or had she died and gone to be reunited with him in Titanic heaven?&nbsp; We had a long talk about that.” Cameron didn’t elaborate as to what the scene was about.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p>A trailer for Titanic</figure><p id=par-4_42>According to the <a href=#>New York Post</a>, Cameron even refused to explain the meaning of the scene to Gloria Stewart, the actress who played the elder version of Rose. Billy Zane recalled “He said, ‘Just lie still, Gloria. You don’t need to know!’”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What James Cameron said about the end of ‘Titanic’ in the film’s audio commentary</h2><p id=par-5_70>Cameron recorded an audio commentary for Titanic in which he had ample time to discuss the film’s ending. Rather than make the ending clear, he emphasized its subjectiveness. “The big ambiguity here is ‘is she alive and dreaming’ or ‘is she dead and on her way to Titanic heaven?’” Cameron said. “I’ll never tell. Of course, I know what we intended….The answer has to be something you supply personally; individually.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Could Celine Dion’s ‘My Heart Will Go On’ provide a clue about the ending?</h2><p id=par-6_98>Can the issue of Titanic’s ending be solved by a close reading of the film itself? As Cameron said, it depends on your taste. However, Celine Dion’s song “My Heart Will Go On” may provide fans with a clue. In the opening of the track, Dion sings “Every night in my dreams/ I see you/I feel you/that is how I know you go on.” This could be seen as implying the ending of the film is a dream rather than a trip to heaven. It depends how much you value Dion’s song in your interpretation of the film.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p>“My Heart Will Go On”</figure><p id=par-7_30>So does Titanic’s ending have a definitive interpretation? Cameron said it’s up to viewers to understand it in their own way. However, Dion’s music might help some fans interpret it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS3ornErGScmZ2av7C6jJ2gnWWipMCmecaoZK2nXZ2yosLEp2Sipl2ptrWtzaKaZqeiYre2v9Nmm6udkaJ6oq7OrqtmopGYuG%2B006ajaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jay-z-once-accused-the-ying-yang-twins-of-of-f-in-up-my-money.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jay-Z Once Accused The Ying Yang Twins of of 'F***in' Up My Money'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dan-aloni-entertainment-executive.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dan Aloni - Entertainment Executive</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kristen-welker-and-john-hughes-still-together-updates.html>Are Kristen Welker and John Hughes Still Together?
