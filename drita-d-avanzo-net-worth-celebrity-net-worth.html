In 1998, Lee was convicted of burglary in Essex County, New Jersey. A few years later, he received a five-year sentence for selling marijuana. In 2003, Lee was sentenced to 62 months in federal prison after being convicted of racketeering, marijuana distribution, money laundering, and loansharking. In 2009, he was convicted of burglary. Consequently, for much of their early marriage, Drita and Lee did not spend much time together. Lee is a former member of the Staten Island gang the New Springville Boys and an associate of the Bonnano crime family. Lee is also the former boyfriend of "Mob Wives" cast member Karen Gravano, which created some tension between Drita and Karen over the years.</p><p>In December 2019, both Lee and Drita were charged with firearms and drug possession after police executed a search warrant at their home. The charges against Drita were dropped, but Lee eventually pleaded guilty to the charge and was sentenced to 64 months in prison. Before the sentencing, Drita wrote a note to the court asking for leniency that read, "If there is one thing no one can take away from Lee is what an amazing father he has been to our children. He never missed a soccer game and was very much involved in our kids' school work and any activities they were involved in. He is a family man and is missed! He has a family that is fully supporting him and hoping he comes home soon."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7zKibnqSjZLGztdOaZJ2Zppa7u7uMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hailee-steinfeld-wore-some-really-unfortunate-lace-pants-from-rodarte-links.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hailee Steinfeld wore some really unfortunate lace pants from Rodarte links</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bad-news-jered-sheline-obituary-news-what-cause-of-death-woodworker-at-purposeful-design-dies-une.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Bad News!
