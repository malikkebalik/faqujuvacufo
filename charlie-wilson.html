His music career has been a part of his life since birth and his whole family was involved in the industry. He currently lives in with his family in Georgia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/world-celebs.com/public/media/resize/800x-/2019/7/13/charlie-wilson-2.jpg><h2 id=tableofcontents1>Quick Bio</h2><p>The rapper was born and raised in Oklahoma by very spiritual parents. His father, Oscar Wilson, was a pastor of their local church. His mother was also a very active church member who often played the piano during the services. The rapper had two brothers, one older and one younger and they would all participate in the choir from a very tender age.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/world-celebs.com/public/media/resize/800x-/2019/7/13/charlie-wilson-3.jpg><p>The rapper extended his singing interest by joining his high school singing group which laid the foundation for his musical career. After completing high school at Booker T in Washington, he went on to study music at Langston University.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/world-celebs.com/public/media/resize/800x-/2019/7/13/charlie-wilson-5.jpg><h2 id=tableofcontents2>Music Career</h2><p>Charlie started singing from a very early age and was always joining musical performances and school bands. His professional career was mostly popularized by his 43 year stint with the gap band which he formed with his two brothers. After the band stint, he went on to perform solo productions full time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/world-celebs.com/public/media/resize/800x-/2019/7/13/charlie-wilson-4.jpg><p>Around 2007, he teamed up with Michael Paran who was to be his solo manager and the two secured a record deal with Jive Records. His first recorded album was an instant hit with popular tracks like the cleverly named; Charlie Last Name Wilson. He went on to release more hits and featured popular rap artists <a href=#>Snoop Dogg</a> and Kanye.

The birth of the band came towards the end of his high school years when he teamed up with his two brother Ronnie and Robert. The trio quickly rose to stardom and became popular locally and across US states in no time at all.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/world-celebs.com/public/media/resize/800x-/2019/7/13/charlie-wilson-and-his-brothers-the-gap-band.jpg><p>They performed all over cities and towns from the early 70s to the late 80s. Their music was mostly raved about for its unique funkiness. Finally in 2010, the band retired their performance and Charlie decided to try out solo performances.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/world-celebs.com/public/media/resize/800x-/2019/7/13/the-gap-band-vintage2.jpg><h2 id=tableofcontents4>Personal life</h2><p>Charlie got hitched to Mahin Tat in 95 after the two had met in a drug-related wellness programme. The social worker helped him get clean and the two have been together since. After fighting a bout of prostate cancer, Wilson went on to advocate and spread awareness of the illness through sponsorship and even dedicated music like the track Mission.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/world-celebs.com/public/media/resize/800x-/2019/7/13/charlie-wilson-with-mahin-tat.jpg><h2 id=tableofcontents5>Net worth</h2><p>The American artist has made quite a bunch of money over his successful career.
