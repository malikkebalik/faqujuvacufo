In a recent interview with <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a>, the actress says the working conditions weren’t ideal.</p><p id=par-7_57>“The first movie we filmed in Portland, Oregon, and I just remember being so cold and miserable,” says Kendrick. “I just remember my Converse being completely soaked through and feeling like, ‘You know, this is a really great group of people and I’m sure that we would be friends at a different time, but I want to murder everyone,’” joked Kendrick.</p><h2>Anna Kendrick’s thoughts on auditioning</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_94>During a 2003 interview with WCSH Channel 6 News, Kendrick said she found the auditioning process unpleasant. “Auditioning is awful,” says Kendrick. “Maybe for somebody it isn’t, but I don’t think there’s anything you can do to get around it. It’s just petrifying. And opening yourself up to whoever is in the room and giving your all and then just waiting to be judged. I mean, it’s certainly not like American Idol, and Simon Cowell is going to tell you that you’re awful, but a ‘Thank you very much, next,’ is just as bad.”</p><p id=par-9_65>Kendrick says she loved being on Broadway, but there were days she just wanted to go back to her hometown in Maine and sleep in her own bed. She recalled a 13-hour rehearsal that took a lot out of her. Kendrick, who was 17 years old at the time of the interview, also says she enjoyed having independence and living in her own apartment.</p><h2>Anna Kendrick’s net worth</h2><p id=par-10_16>As of this writing, Kendrick has a net worth of $20 million, according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a> estimates.</p><h2>What’s next for Anna Kendrick</h2><p id=par-11_20>Kendrick is currently starring in the HBO Max series Love Life.
