Credit: WENN.com</p><p>Jenny McCarthy has never really kept anything about her life a secret. From posing for Playboy, to her relationship with Jim Carrey, to her life as a mother of an autistic child, to her advocacy on behalf of autistic children and families living and dealing with autism, Jenny has never held back. Even though I don’t always agree with her or her methods, I admire her tenacity and her outlook on life.</p><p>One of the few things that Jenny rarely spoke about was her marriage and divorce to John Asher, who is the father to their son Evan. From what I’ve seen, Jenny usually takes responsibility for her part in their split, while acknowledging that their son’s diagnosis with autism was a major factor.</p><p>John Asher has given an interview that pretty much confirms that, saying “When something traumatic happens to a child, it either pulls the parents together or drives them apart.” Very true. Unfortunately, he also talks about how his ex-wife was/is “a freak in the sack”:</p><p>Busty actress/model Jenny McCarthy’s ex has revealed he misses nights of passion with the star – because she was “a freak in the sack”.</p><p>Actor/director John Asher, who was married to McCarthy from 1999 to 2005, feels sure his ex-wife’s current beau, Jim Carrey, is having the time of his life in the bedroom – because the actress really knows how to spice up sex.</p><p>Asher revealed his ex liked threesomes and once even invited three other “naughty sweet young girls” to join them for sex in a recent ConwayAndWhitman.com interview. [sic]</p><p>He said, “She’d be the subject of most of the attention, but always kept me in the mix. Jenny was a freak in the sack and beyond.”</p><p>“There are some things that she’s done where I’ve thought, ‘No other woman will ever do that.’ It’s a helluva show.” Asher reveals his marriage ended when the couple’s son Evan was diagnosed with autism and needed his mum’s full-time attention.</p><p>The writer/director explains, “When something traumatic happens to a child, it either pulls the parents together or drives them apart.”</p><p>From <a href=#>PR-Inside</a></p><p>There’s something so unseemly about an ex-husband or an ex-boyfriend talking in graphic sexual terms about his ex-wife/ex-girlfriend. Even though John Asher probably meant it all as a compliment, there might be a little bit of a man-to-man poke at Jim Carrey, I think. Like John is saying to Jim Carrey, “Hey, I nailed her first, and I had no complaints.” But I don’t think Jim Carrey has any complaints either – he’s very publicly taken over as surrogate father to Evan, and <a href=#>he’s even given Jenny and her son a $50 million trust</a>. It can’t just be about freaky sex – that’s love.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/wenn167751.jpg alt=wenn167751 title=wenn167751 width=600 height=590 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbWtkZoFwtsSnpbKXnZiwor7TobCsl5WteqnB0puYp5yPqK66v76sn56rj5asp77EmqKYoZ6UwamxvqyYnKOPobasscOYq6GqlZrAsLnErJawmZmprLW7vqmsm6SZqLVw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./melissa-de-sousa-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Melissa De Sousa Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-the-curse-of-oak-island-season-10-renewed-or-not.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is The Curse Of Oak Island Season 10 Renewed or Not?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kristen-welker-and-john-hughes-still-together-updates.html>Are Kristen Welker and John Hughes Still Together?
