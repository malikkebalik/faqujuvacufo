He began acting while he was a student at Cambridge University, appearing in stage productions of "Fiddler on the Roof" and "Cyrano de Bergerac" with the Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club; he also performed in plays at the Habonim Dror Jewish theatre. After leaving Cambridge, Baron Cohen worked as a fashion model until he was offered a job hosting a weekly show with future BBC weathercaster Carol Kirkwood. He then moved on to Channel 4's "Pump TV" (1995 to 1996) and Granada Talk TV's "F2F" (1996). Sacha also trained to become a clown at the École Philippe Gaulier in Paris.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Baron Cohen began appearing on Channel 4's "The 11 O'Clock Show" in 1998, gaining attention for his character Ali G. His work on "The 11 O'Clock Show" led to a Best Newcomer award at the British Comedy Award in 1999, and "GQ" magazine named Sacha the comedian of the year. In 2000, he appeared in his first movie, "The Jolly Boys' Last Stand," and "Da Ali G Show" premiered. Borat and Brüno regularly appeared on the show, becoming fan favorites, and viewers loved Borat's "serious" interviews with celebrities, including <a href=# title="Ralph Nader Net Worth">Ralph Nader</a>, <a href=# title="Gore Vidal Net Worth">Gore Vidal</a>, <a href=# title="Donald Trump Net Worth">Donald Trump</a>, and <a href=# title="Newt Gingrich Net Worth">Newt Gingrich</a>.

The men, who made offensive racist remarks in the film, claimed that they were drunk when they signed the release forms and that they were told that "Borat" wouldn't be shown in the U.S. Sacha was also sued by an etiquette tutor who appeared in the film, but both lawsuits ended up being dismissed. In 2009, he was sued by a charity worker who appeared in "Brüno," alleging that she was disabled as a result of Baron Cohen attacking her while filming at a charity bingo tournament for seniors. Since the incident was on film, it was easy to prove that the allegations were false, so the case was dismissed. The following year, a Palestinian grocer sued Baron Cohen for defamation, saying that "Brüno" had falsely portrayed him as a terrorist; the case was settled out of court in 2012. In 2018, he was sued by Roy Moore for $95 million after the Alabama politician took part in a mock interview on "Who Is America?," Sacha's Showtime series. In the interview, Baron Cohen posed as an anti-terrorism expert with a "pedophile detector" that beeped when it was near Moore, who had been accused of sexual assault and child molestation while (unsuccessfully) running for a Senate seat in 2017.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Sacha married actress <a href=# title="Isla Fisher Net Worth">Isla Fisher</a> on March 15, 2010, in Paris, after a 6-year engagement.

"Borat" also earned Baron Cohen a Golden Globe, a Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award, a San Francisco Film Critics Circle Award, and a Toronto Film Critics Association Award as well as an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. The Evening Standard British Film Awards has awarded him the <a href=# title="Peter Sellers Net Worth">Peter Sellers</a> Award for Comedy twice: in 2007 for "Borat" and in 2010 for "Brüno." The Anti Defamation League honored Sacha with an International Leadership Award in 2019 for his commitment to exposing racism and bigotry through satire.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 2005, Sacha paid $2.45 million for a 2,800 square foot home in the Hollywood Hills.
