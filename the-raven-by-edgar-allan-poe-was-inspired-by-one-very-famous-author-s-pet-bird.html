"The Raven" turns out to have been an actual, living creature, although the real bird was somewhat less foreboding than its namesake. Having been featured previously in his owner's novel, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Dickens' pet raven, Grip</a>, might just be the most literary bird of all time.</p><p>Dickens wrote Grip into his 1841 novel, <i>Barnaby Rudge</i>, where his pet featured as a talkative companion to the title character. Already a fan of his fellow writer, Poe reviewed the first few chapters of the novel for <i>Graham's Magazine</i>, and was delighted with the avian character, whom he found to be "intensely amusing." When he learned that Dickens was planning a family trip to the U.S. the following year, Poe wrote to him to request a meeting, which <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Dickens was "very glad" to agree to</a>.</p><p>Grip came to the U.S. along with his master, and Poe was surprised to learn that the character he had admired had a basis in reality. Dickens' pet raven was just as talkative and disagreeable as his <i>Barnaby Rudge</i> namesake, to the extent that his behavior had exiled him to the family's carriage house.</p><p>Poe published <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>"The Raven"</a> in 1845. The connection between his talking bird and Dickens' did not go over his critics' heads. Atlas Obscura notes that "Poe was taunted with the refrain 'Here comes <a href=# class=T3D>Poe with his Raven</a>, like Barnaby Rudge, / Three fifths of him genius, two fifths sheer fudge.'" The heckling was not entirely uncalled for; the Grip of <i>Barnaby Rudge</i> was known for "tapping at the door," among other quirks that later appeared in Poe's poem.</p><p>"The Raven" turned out to be Poe's most successful work. Unfortunately, the <a href=# class=T3D>troubled writer died four years later, under mysterious circumstances</a>. He is buried in Baltimore at Westminster Hall and Burial Ground.</p><p>After his pet died, Dickens had Grip taxidermied. The stuffed bird is on display in the Free Library of Philadelphia's Rare Book Department.</p><p><i>Image: <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Wikimedia Commons</a></i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyhZBwZ3FlpJ2ybr7Ar5ynZZKueqawxpqpZpmcoa6vec%2BonGavkah6qrrSqaCrnZRir7p5zqecZq6Vp8ZussCmpq6rXZbCtbTOq6pmqJWpeqO10Z0%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gaston-glock-death-vienna-austria-an-icon-in-the-firearms-industry-has-died.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gaston Glock Death, Vienna, Austria, An Icon In The Firearms Industry Has Died</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-do-people-want-to-boycott-doritos-the-doritos-controversy-explained.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why do people want to boycott Doritos?
