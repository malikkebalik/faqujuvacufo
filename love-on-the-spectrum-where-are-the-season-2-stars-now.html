Emily and I have both decided to be platonic… It has made me more open to dating and the idea of being in love.&nbsp;The show has taught me that there is a lot of time, effort, and work that goes into dating and getting to know someone.&nbsp;It gives me confidence to know I have been on several dates now.&nbsp;I hope to one day find the right woman.”</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=309 data-injectable=false>In the same interview, Connor revealed that he has been “doing well” nonetheless, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">spending time with his family</a> and his dogs, watching shows on Netflix — such as The Dragon Prince,&nbsp;Blue Eye Samurai, DreamWorks Dragons, and Super Giant Robot Brothers, — as well as reading, and more.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Tanner — Single</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Love-on-the-Spectrum-Tanner-3.png><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false>Sharing some of his biggest interests throughout the show — such as United States history, karaoke, and animals — Tanner Smith is truly a bundle of joy.

While she and Talia appeared to be in it for the long haul, it looks like things took a turn for the worse once filming came to a close…</p><p>“I haven’t been on a single date since the show and I can’t manage to get past the talking stage even after all this time. I’m still looking for a girlfriend but it’s less important to me than it was last spring… I learned that finding love isn’t an easy process. There’s so much more to finding love than just having similar interests. You have to be compatible, trusting, and fair to the other person. Although I’m still looking, I can’t wait for the day where I find my perfect girl!”</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=266 data-injectable=false>Admitting that “life is happy right now,” the Illinois native appears to be content nonetheless, despite admitting in the same interview that she is “still painfully single.” Hopefully someday she finds the “perfect girl” for her!</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Dani — Taken</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Love-on-the-Spectrum-Dani.png><p data-characters=202 data-current-count=202 data-injectable=false>Dani Bowman had an interesting journey during season 2 of Love on the Spectrum US, rekindling her romance with a man named <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Adan</a>, someone who she rejected during season 1 of the series.

While they are seemingly in love, Dani admitted in an exclusive interview with Netflix that they do not spend as much time together as she would hope, delving into the details.</p><p>“Adan and I are currently staying connected through text messages. Our last date was in July, and I recognize that he’s juggling a busy schedule with college and a part-time job. I genuinely wish we could find more time to spend together. On a positive note, my best friend Devin has suggested the idea of meeting somewhere in the middle for our next date. It sounds like a great plan to bridge the distance and make our time together more manageable.”</p><p data-characters=259 data-current-count=259 data-injectable=false>Aside from her relationship, the 29-year-old is still extremely invested in her animation company called DaniMation, which she talked about a great deal on the show, admitting in the same interview that it is doing better than ever.
