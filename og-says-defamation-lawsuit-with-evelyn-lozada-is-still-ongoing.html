Lozada eventually sued OG for defamation after OG pointed out several racist comments Lozada made on air. OG countersued. And according to the former reality TV star, the lawsuit remains active, and OG says it’s because of Lozada’s antics to try and delay due process.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2><strong>Evelyn Lozada sued OG for defamation</strong></h2><p id=par-2_80>Fans began to call Lozada out for referring to OG as “ugly” and using an emoji of a monkey to describe her in one of her Instagram posts, and she also called OG a cockroach in Spanish to another co-star. She was accused of <a href=#>being a colorist</a> and treating OG differently for being of a darker skin tone. Lozada also called OG “aggressive,” which OG and viewers pointed out as a term that is used to describe darker-skinned Black women.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p>Source: YouTube</figure><p id=par-3_40>Lozada denied the colorist claims by using noting her Afro-Latina heritage. She also apologized to another co-star, Cece Guiterrez, for using a racial slur against her. Lozada sued OG after OG posted social media messages about Lozada being a colorist.</p><p id=par-4_83><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ reported</a> that Lozada’s court documents revealed that she claimed she’s of Hispanic descent and “her 2 children are African and Hispanic descent.” She also noted that she’s the chairperson of her foundation that raises money for abused women and has raised thousands of dollars for the Sauti Yeti Center for African Women – which in turn “are actions of a person that is not racist.” Lozada claimed she lost money from endorsements over OG’s allegations, and that she also suffered emotional distress.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>OG says Evelyn Lozada sued her to get her fired from the show</strong></h2><p id=par-5_103>She joined the show in Season 7 and instantly clashed with Lozada. During a recent appearance on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reality With the King podcast</a>, OG explained that it was typical for Lozada to haze newbies, but she refused to back down from her. She also alleged that producers and her <a href=#>co-stars set her up</a> multiple times to be attacked by Lozada and co. but she always won the arguments, which was a surprise to all. After a while, she says Lozada refused to film with her when she realized she met her match in OG and pulled a move to try and have her fired.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p>Source: YouTube</figure><p id=par-6_67>“I received a lawsuit from my co-worker, and she sued me because she was making nasty racist statements, and I called her out on it. And then I got used, and then I got a restraining order that they tried to have issued against me that was ultimately dismissed,” she told Carlos King. “So that’s what started the catalyst of even more talks of them firing me.”</p><p id=par-7_50>OG noted that she initially signed on for a five-year contract but began to complain to network executives about the way she was treated on the show. From there, she says there were calculated attempts to push her out, which included bad editing to make her appear as the aggressor.</p><h2 id=h-where-things-currently-stand-with-the-lawsuit><strong>Where things currently stand with the lawsuit</strong></h2><p id=par-8_54>Unfortunately, OG says the lawsuit is still ongoing. She told King that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, their court process has been delayed. OG also says Lozada has changed legal teams multiple times and refuses to appear in person, alleging she’s afraid of OG. They are now scheduled to go to court in 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvor%2FKnqubmZyheri11Z6qZqeXYsCixdJmm56ekaKutbXOp2SlmaeowqrAjLCgraBdmsOmuNinZKWnqpaxonnIrGSsrJmhuW67zaCmoqaXY7W1ucto</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-are-mexican-roofs-made-of.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What are Mexican roofs made of?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./javale-mcgee-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>JaVale McGee Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kristen-welker-and-john-hughes-still-together-updates.html>Are Kristen Welker and John Hughes Still Together?
