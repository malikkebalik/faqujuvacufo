Therefore, she didn’t know she had family in the UK and states across the country, including California, Texas, and Arizona.</p><p id=par-5_22>She credited the show for reconnecting her with her extended family, noting, “Tough as Nails is definitely a life changer for me.”</p><h2><strong>Sergio Robles and Mister Frost picked their Dirty Hands and Savage teams</strong></h2><p id=par-6_20>The season kicked off with 12 new competitors facing off in an opening challenge to determine who would pick teams.</p><p id=par-7_27>California-based foreman Sergio Robles and Oklahoma-based welder Mister Frost were the first two to blow up a small dinghy boat and replace a boot monitoring system, respectively.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-8_22>Therefore, Sergio went first and decided to continue the legacy of Dirty Hands, defaulting Mister to the leader of the Savage crew.</p><p id=par-9_55>The foreman selected Georgia-based laborer Aly Bala, Virginia-based shipboard electrician Beth Salva-Clifford, California-based concrete form setter Jorge Zavala, Ellery, and Synethia to round out his team, while Mister went with dry mason Renèe Kolar, Virginia-based general contractor Laura Bernotas, Texas-based diesel technician Larron Ables, Hawaii-based construction worker Ilima Shim, and Pennsylvania-based pipeline laborer Jake Cope.</p><h2><strong>Synethia was the first eliminated from ‘Tough as Nails’ Season 4</strong></h2><p id=par-10_26>For their first team challenge, the groups had to use pickup trucks to transport supplies in order to build an outdoor shade structure on Catalina Island.</p><p id=par-11_45>Ellery misplaced the number the teams had to nail on the frame when finished, giving Savage the opportunity to pull ahead and take the win, earning the group $12,000. However, Dirty Hands redeemed themselves at the following challenge by correctly building a concrete slab first.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-12_39>After the challenges, the contestant faced off individually to avoid overtime and earn an extra $2,000. Jake finished first, pocketing the cash, while Ellery and Synethia were the last two to complete building a section of a retaining wall.</p><p id=par-13_81>Therefore, they went into overtime, where the competitors had to forge a helmet hook to hang their hard hats. Synethia struggled at the beginning as she had difficulty hammering the steel, allowing Ellery to obtain a comfortable lead that he never gave up, ultimately pulling out the win. While Synethia is no longer in the running for the $200,000 cash prize and Ford Super Duty truck, she can still earn money when Dirty Hands wins challenges.&nbsp;Tough as Nails&nbsp;airs Wednesdays on <a href=#>CBS.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBsMHGoWSaq12jrqq40maqsqaVqbWqrYyrnJynnqOypMCMn5imoZyueq6xzJucq6tencGuuI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./victor-wembanyama-parents-height-in-feet.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Victor Wembanyama parents height in feet</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-margrave-georgia-a-real-place.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Margrave, Georgia a Real Place?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kristen-welker-and-john-hughes-still-together-updates.html>Are Kristen Welker and John Hughes Still Together?
