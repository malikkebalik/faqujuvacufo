But there’s still some interesting stuff to be sorted through with the Sony Hack documents. Here are some stories percolating through the interwebs:</p><p>*George Clooney is going to be working with Sony on a film about the Rupert Murdoch/News of the World hacking debacle. The Sony hackers got their hands on some emails between Clooney and Amy Pascal – <a href=#>go here to see</a>. Apparently, George already assumed he’s being hacked, and acts accordingly.</p><p>*Joel McHale is really nice. He <a href=#>sweetly emailed</a> a Sony mid-level executive and asked for a discounted TV that he was promised.</p><p>*Kevin Hart has been making comedies with Sony and they’ve been increasingly profitable and popular. So, Kevin wanted a little extra money to do a little extra promotion for one of his films – his manager asked Sony to include some extra pay for Kevin to promote his film on social media, because his contract to promote the film (probably Think Like a Man Too) was just for interviews and TV appearances, not for social media. So, obviously, some Sony executive wrote about Hart: “I’m not saying he’s a whore, but he’s a whore.” There’s a discussion about what kind of precedent it sets if they give Hart a little bit more for social media shilling – <a href=#>go here to read</a>.</p><p>*And here’s one of the more disturbing exchanges:</p><p>Before Sony Pictures chair Amy Pascal attended a breakfast of Hollywood bigwigs last November with Barack Obama, she emailed her friend Scott Rudin for suggestions on what she should ask the president.</p><p>In what has become the latest embarrassing email uncovered in a trove of messages leaked by hackers who attacked Sony, Pascal wrote Rudin: “What should I ask the president at this stupid Jeffrey breakfast?” She was referring to a breakfast hosted by DreamWorks Animation head and major Democratic donor Jeffrey Katzenberg.</p><p>Rudin, a top film producer responsible for films like No Country for Old Men and Moneyball, responded, “Would he like to finance some movies.” Pascal replied, “I doubt it. Should I ask him if he liked DJANGO?” Rudin responded: “12 YEARS.” Pascal quickly continued down the path of guessing Obama preferred movies by or starring African Americans. “Or the butler. Or think like a man? [sic]”</p><p>Rudin’s response: “Ride-along. I bet he likes Kevin Hart.”</p><p>At a fundraiser later that evening at DreamWorks’ studio, Obama didn’t express a particular preference for the films Rudin and Pascal listed, telling a crowd of Hollywood executives, “Believe it or not, entertainment is part of our American diplomacy.”</p><p>Pascal is a major Democratic donor; she gave $5,000 to Obama’s re-election campaign and cut a $30,800 check to the Democratic National Committee, according to OpenSecrets.</p><p><a href=#>[From Buzzfeed]</a></p><p>So… Amy Pascal is a Democratic donor who likes to “joke” about how the president of the United States only likes movies about slavery or movies starring Kevin Hart? Good lord. How embarrassing for them.</p><p>Meanwhile, I’ve been sort of surprised by the lack of formal statements from the people involved – however unwillingly – in these controversies. Angelina Jolie hasn’t made a statement. Neither has Amy Pascal. <a href=#>But Rudin did tell the NYT</a>: “This is not about salacious emails being batted around by Gawker and Defamer. It’s about a criminal act, and the people behind it should be treated as nothing more nor less than criminals.” Sure. I don’t think there’s any question that the hack was a criminal act. But it’s also a HUGE gossip story.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/wenn5489145.jpg alt=wenn5489145 width=430 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/wenn21082560.jpg alt=wenn21082560 width=480 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/wenn21829688.jpg alt=wenn21829688 width=480 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbWhhboFye9KopbKXmJawrKvAprCYqJGosKK4vqyaqKyklL%2B2sMinlquZk57ArnnToqWgnZSUsq6tyKWqmJmSpMK1q8%2BrnKyXn5eurq2O</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-only-led-zeppelin-album-that-came-with-a-full-lyric-sheet.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Only Led Zeppelin Album That Came With a Full Lyric Sheet</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./seo-kang-joon-height-eyes-5urprise-acting-net-worth-ideal-type.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Seo Kang Joon Height, Eyes, 5urprise, Acting, Net Worth, Ideal Type</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kristen-welker-and-john-hughes-still-together-updates.html>Are Kristen Welker and John Hughes Still Together?
