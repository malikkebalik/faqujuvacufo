He majored in Computer Science, but then switched to Communications at the last minute, and ultimately dropped out. He had always been a "Saturday Night Live" fan, and post-college, he set out on the stand-up comedy circuit, ending up in Los Angeles, where he continued to perform. He began appearing in small roles on film,while studying with the famed improv troupe, The Groundlings.&nbsp; In 1988, he was invited to audition for "Saturday Night Live", and he joined the program for the 1998-1999 season.&nbsp; He went on to become a popular member of the cast, and remained with the show until 2004. After attempting a moderately successful film career, he returned to television, hosting "Late Night with Jimmy Fallon". His talk show has become a favorite spot for celebrities, artists, and politicians looking to reach a "hipper" audience, and it has also become a showcase for Mr. Fallon's musical talent.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-352405 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jimmy-Fallon-1.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-352405 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Paul Drinkwater/NBCUniversal via Getty Images)</p><h2 id=salary><strong>Salary</strong></h2><p>Jimmy's annual salary for hosting The Tonight Show is $16 million.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Jimmy Fallon was born on September 19, 1974, in the Bay Ridge neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York.
