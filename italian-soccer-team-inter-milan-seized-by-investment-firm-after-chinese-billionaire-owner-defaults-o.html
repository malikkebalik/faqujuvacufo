The loan was taken out in the first place as the team's finances were shaken by the COVID-19 pandemic, and despite its recent championship success the terms of the loan were evidently too steep even for its billionaire owners to keep up with.</p><p>What happens now? Despite being new to sports team ownership, The Oaktree source says it's "in no rush to sell the club" and that they're "planning to invest time and effort" to maximize the value of their somewhat unexpected investment. The source went on:</p><p><strong>"There's an opportunity at the board and outside the board to connect with the community, the institutions, and the companies around Milan."</strong></p><p>The seizure comes as Suning has been facing myriad other financial challenges in the last few years, thanks in large part to both the pandemic and a property crisis in China.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue56pdGxuZmWAeQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jacksepticeye-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jacksepticeye Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./embeth-davidtz-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Embeth Davidtz Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kristen-welker-and-john-hughes-still-together-updates.html>Are Kristen Welker and John Hughes Still Together?
