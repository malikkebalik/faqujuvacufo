If your relationship with your mom is questionable, there may be some <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>signs your mom is a sociopath.</a> Although the personality disorder isn't terribly common, if your mom has exhibited some alarming tendencies in the past, including extreme lack of empathy, it may be the case that she has this particular mental disorder.</p><p>"Sociopathy, which is actually called 'Antisocial Personality Disorder,' is an enduring disorder marked by lack of empathy, callousness, egocentrism, and an incapacity for reciprocal intimate relationships," says <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Rebecca Burton, LMFT</a> over email. "In my practice, clients who believe their mother is sociopathic truly struggle — with the relationship with their mother of course, but sometimes in other areas of their lives. The basic lack of empathy from a parental figure leaves a painful void in their lives. They often must learn empathy, since they did not witness it receive it as children."</p><p>Only a true mental health professional can diagnose your mother with any personality disorders she may have, but if you are suspicious that something is off with your parent, you should watch out for these nine signs that your mom could be a sociopath.</p><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">1</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">She's Nice To Others & Mean To You</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>Pexels</p></figure><p>Sociopaths are able to turn on a superficial charm when they want something from others, so those not related to you but be used to seeing your mom's good side. "How confusing it is to be her daughter," says Burton. "People love her and praise her sparkling personality, her generosity, or her intelligence. But behind closed doors, she's cruel and hurtful."</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">2</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">She Never Apologizes</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>Pexels</p></figure><p>Because sociopaths are so self-focused, your mom likely never apologizes about the times she was wrong. "She never, ever says she's sorry, and she doesn't believe she has to," says Burton. "She's the star of her own life, and she is ruthless about getting her needs met."</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">3</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">She Steals From You</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>Pexels</p></figure><p>"She steals your money, your credit rating, or your boyfriend," says Burton. "She takes what she wants, with no remorse. This could mean using your social security number to take out credit cards, tapping into your bank account, or sending inappropriate messages to your sweetheart. What she wants, she believes she should have."</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">4</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">She Makes Fun Of You When You Cry</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>Pexels</p></figure><p>Because sociopaths have a lack of empathy, they won't find it upsetting when you're upset. "Most children, even as adults, naturally look to their parents for comfort, reassurance, or understanding," says Burton. "The child of a sociopath gets just the opposite. Therapy can be helpful to address the confusion, pain, and grief that comes with having a sociopathic mother."</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">5</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">She Purposely Hurts Others</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>Pexels</p></figure><p>Some conflict comes from lack of maturity, restraint, or understanding, but a sociopathic mother knows when her actions can cause harm to others — she just doesn't care. "Your mom creates opportunities for you to get hurt, and then finds it funny to watch your pain, sometimes pointing it out to others, rather than protecting your privacy and helping to comfort you," says Burton.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">6</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">She Manipulates You</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>Pexels</p></figure><p>"You have a sense that you are manipulated when you are with her, but it's so subtle, you can't put your finger on it," says <a href=# rel=noreferrer>psychologist Dr. Helen Odessky</a> over email. "This isn't your average guilt trip. You find yourself agreeing to things readily and later wonder how it happened. Someone with antisocial personality disorder will often be a skillful manipulator."</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">7</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">She Puts You In Risky Situations</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>Pexels</p></figure><p>Sociopaths tend to be impulsive, which means they tend to put others in risky situations. "If you get a sense that personal safety or safety of others are not often on her radar, she may have sociopathic tendencies," says Odessky. "People with antisocial personality disorder are impulsive, do not assess risk well, or learn from prior experience."</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">8</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">She Is Hostile</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>Pexels</p></figure><p>Watch out for anger and hostility as some prominent personality traits. "People with antisocial personality traits are prone to antagonistic behavior, as aggressive behavior can shift power dynamics in a relationship and help them get what they want," says Odessky.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">9</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">She Lies</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>Pexels</p></figure><p>Sociopaths also tend to be deceitful. "If your mother is prone to lying about things big and small, she may have traits of antisocial personality disorder, particularly if she lies for personal gain," says Odessky.</p></figure><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC8jnJkrKGXo8Buxc6uqWaln6J6rrXGoatmmpVirm6%2FzpygqKiRqbVugpRtZ3A%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./emeka-okafor-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Emeka Okafor Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ncis-actor-and-vanderpump-rules-cameraman-detained-in-connection-with-disturbing-case.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'NCIS' Actor and 'Vanderpump Rules' Cameraman Detained In Connection With Disturbing Case</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kristen-welker-and-john-hughes-still-together-updates.html>Are Kristen Welker and John Hughes Still Together?
