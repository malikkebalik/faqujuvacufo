Starting Thursday, Feb. 1, a fresh batch of farmers will try their luck at finding love on TV. Will they have more success than the men from season 1? Unfortunately, Farmer Landon, Farmer Allen, Farmer Hunter, and Farmer Ryan didn’t meet the women of their dreams on the show, though they did walk away from the experience with lasting friendships. Here’s where the cast of Farmer Wants a Wife Season 1 is in 2024.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Landon Heaton is still friends with some of the ‘Farmer Wants a Wife’ cast</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Landon-Farmer-Wants-a-Wife-1.jpg><p id=par-2_57>In the Farmer Wants a Wife Season 1 finale, Landon Heaton had to choose between Ashley L. and Ashley R. He declared his love for Ashley L., but unfortunately, the romance didn’t last. In June 2023, they confirmed they’d split up a month after filming the show’s last episode. There were no hard feelings on either side&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_17>“<a href=#>Ashley is an exceptional woman</a> and I look forward to watching her succeed,” Landon shared on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>.</p><p id=par-4_24>“We are friends and always will be,” Ashley said in a post on her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>. “I am forever grateful for meeting a one-of-a-kind man.”</p><p id=par-5_58>Though things didn’t work out with Ashley, Landon did walk away from the show with some new friendships. He and fellow farmer Allen Foster have spent time hanging out with season 1’s Sydney Groom. But he’s keeping things strictly platonic with Sydney. “Lol no,” he replied on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> in January 2024 when someone asked if they were together.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Allen Foster is still single</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_51>Allen ended up choosing Khelsi, a teacher from Georgia, to join him on his farm at the end of Farmer Wants a Wife Season 1. But it didn’t work out. Shortly after the finale, they <a href=#>confirmed they were not together</a>, with Khelsi implying on social media that the breakup wasn’t amicable.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_41>Since his time on the Fox show, Allen has thrown himself back into ranching life. As for a relationship, he’s still single. One of his fellow farmers from season 1 even took to social media to find him a new lady.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_27>“​​With a simple message … you can save me from having to hear how lonely this sad, dirty cowboy is,” Landon captioned the joking post on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Hunter Grayson is ‘grateful’ for the ‘Farmer Wants a Wife’ experience&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_37>Georgia farmer Hunter Grayson found love with event planner Meghan Baker on Farmer Wants a Wife. But in late June 2023, they confirmed that they’d split. Despite the breakup, Hunter has no regrets about doing the show.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_74>“One year ago…. I had no idea it would become one of the greatest experiences of my life,” he shared in an October 2023 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> post. “I will be forever grateful to all that were involved. To the amazing ladies, thank you just doesn’t seem enough for everything y’all went through, I stand by my statement of wishing each of you the world. Here’s to the future and what it brings, cheers to all!”</p><p id=par-11_19>Though he and Meghan are no longer a couple, it doesn’t sound like there’s any bad blood between them.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_25>“Couldn’t have said it any better,” she wrote in reply to Hunter’s post. “Here’s to the future! Let us remember it’s all in God’s hands.”</p><p id=par-13_56>Based on his social media updates, Hunter appears to be single. But in October 2023, he spent time at Universal Studios Orlando with Allen’s ex Khelsi for what she called a “tiny, mini [Farmer Wants a Wife] reunion” on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>. That led some fans to wonder if they were dating. However, neither has confirmed a relationship.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-farmer-ryan-is-in-a-relationship>Farmer Ryan is in a relationship&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Ryan-and-Haley-Farmer-Wants-a-Wife.jpg><p id=par-14_48>Ryan Black was the only guy from the first season of Farmer Wants a Wife who wound up <a href=#>single at the end of the show</a>.

He added that he has zero regrets about doing the show, which he described as “a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.” And he’s thrilled that he came out of the experience with lasting friendships with the other farmers.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-16_29>“We are still just itching to see each other and hang out,” he said. “I couldn’t ask for more when it comes to what I got from this show.”</p><p id=par-17_14>Farmer Wants a Wife Season 2 premieres Thursday, Feb. 1 at 9 p.m. ET.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-18_16>For more on the entertainment world and exclusive interviews, subscribe to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Showbiz Cheat Sheet’s YouTube channel</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSzor7Mnqlmr5GjwbR5wGauop6VYsKxsMCtnGarlZbAsLqMamScmaOpe6nAzKVm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./11-reasons-megara-from-hercules-is-super-underrated.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>11 Reasons Megara From 'Hercules' Is Super Underrated</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-full-house-scene-with-uncle-jesse-and-michelle-crying-is-still-heartbreaking.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The 'Full House' Scene With Uncle Jesse and Michelle Crying Is Still Heartbreaking</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kristen-welker-and-john-hughes-still-together-updates.html>Are Kristen Welker and John Hughes Still Together?
