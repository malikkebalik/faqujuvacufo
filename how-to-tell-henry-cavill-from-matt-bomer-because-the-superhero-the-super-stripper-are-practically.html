Case in point: <a href=# class=T3D><i>The Man From U.N.C.L.E.</i> star Henry Cavill</a>, who plays an American secret agent who teams up with a Russian (Armie Hammer) to take down an international criminal organization with Nazi ties in the '60s-set film. Cavill is everything you could want in a cinematic super spy: he's dashing, charming, and can wear the crap out of a tailored suit. Seems like he'd be in a class of his own. Then why are some fans getting confused about who <i>actually </i>stars in this thriller? Because Cavill has a near-identical, non-biological Hollywood twin. Yes, really: <a href=# class=T3D>Henry Cavill and Matt Bomer look <i>exactly</i> alike.</a></p><p>What a time to be alive. As if Henry Cavill weren't enough eye candy for fans, he's got a doppelgänger who's just as lovely to look at. They've got matching chiseled faces and piercing eyes. They're both working quite a bit lately and making tons of appearances on red carpets and in photoshoots. Their shared resemblance is causing some problems with fans who might need contacts in a stronger prescription to be able to tell them apart. Twitter is on fire right now with people plagued by the Cavill-Or-Bomer dilemma. Feel their pain.</p><p>To aid in their identification, I've put together this primer on how to tell Henry Cavill and Matt Bomer apart.</p><h3>The Superhero: Henry Cavill</h3><p>That's Cavill who won the coveted part of Clark Kent and his super alter-ego in the 2013 film <i>Man Of Steel</i>. He's reprising the role in the upcoming sequel <i>Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice</i>, which you <i>maybe </i>have heard of.</p><h3>The Super-Stripper: Matt Bomer</h3><p>Speaking of breathlessly awaited sequels, Bomer took the strip-club stage again this summer in <i>Magic Mike XXL</i>. This time around, his character Ken got to showcase his singing skills as well. Bomer showed off the pipes that also won him a recurring role as Blaine's brother on <i>Glee</i>. His resemblance to Darren Criss needs a whole other post.</p><h3>The Brit: Henry Cavill</h3><p></p><p>Just let that accent wash over you.</p><h3>The Yankee: Matt Bomer</h3><p></p><p>Bomer is a homegrown, American boy who was born in Missouri, grew up in Texas, studied acting in Pennsylvania before moving to New York and embarking on a career on stage and screen.</p><h3>The Single Guy: Henry Cavill</h3><p>Cavill is still single, though he's had a few high-profile relationships. Remember that short stint with <i>Big Bang Theory </i>actress Kaley Cuoco? Other girlfriends include British equestrian Ellen Whitaker and, most recently, MMA fighter/actress Gina Carano. But he's not settling down yet.</p><h3>The Family Man: Matt Bomer</h3><p>Meanwhile, Matt Bomer is as settled as can be. He married publicist Simon Hall in 2011 and couple have three children. He's used his fame and talent as a platform to advocate for human rights, and won a Golden Globe last year for portraying an AIDS patient in the HBO film <i>The Normal Heart.</i></p><p>So there you have it: though equally talented and equally beautiful, Henry Cavill and Matt Bomer are actually two different men.
