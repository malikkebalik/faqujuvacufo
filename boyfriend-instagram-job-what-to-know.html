Alexia partially chalked that up to some moments of true “vulnerability,” explaining, “It’s really scary putting your career out there for people to see, especially when you’re trying so hard to make it and prove something.”</p><p>Nowadays, Alexia has “kind of shifted that gear of being super nervous into actually being kind of excited to be that person that’s really relatable,” she added. Get to know more about the 26-year-old Buying Beverly Hills agent below.</p><h2>Alexia Umansky’s Job</h2><p>Alexia, who holds a degree in marketing communication from Emerson University, is a real estate agent at Mauricio’s company, The Agency, and also serves as <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>the team’s marketing specialist</a>. A Los Angeles native, she started going to various showings and open houses with Mauricio when she was young. “As I grew up, I would come into the office to shadow him and always learned something new,” Alexia wrote in her bio on the company’s website. “Real estate is something I always knew I loved. And I quickly realized I could devote my life to this industry and be happy.”</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><h2>Alexia Umansky’s Boyfriend</h2><p>Though some Netflix viewers were quick to ship Alexia and her high school friend, Joey Ben-Zvi, she already has a longtime <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>boyfriend named Jake Zingerman</a>. Neither has been particularly shy about sharing their relationship on social media either. Days before Buying Beverly Hills premiered, Alexia shared <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>photos from a Halloween celebration</a>, including some PDA. Further back, in August 2021, she also posted a photo of them <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>kissing mid-selfie</a>.</p><p>On his own Instagram account, Jake also <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>celebrated Alexia’s 26th birthday</a> in June with a sweet tribute. “My best friend and whole heart. The most amazing girl in the world. I love you with everything I got. 26 never looked so good,” he captioned the post.</p><p>Meanwhile, he’s also <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>won the approval</a> of her family, including her other sisters Sophia and Portia Umansky, according to Mauricio. “He’s awesome,” the Agency owner recently told Us Weekly. “We love him.”</p><h2>Alexia Umansky’s Instagram</h2><p>In her free time, Alexia enjoys skiing, going to the beach, cooking, trying out the latest restaurants, dancing, and traveling. She also volunteers for Children's Hospital Los Angeles, organizing everything from bake sale fundraisers to holiday gift drives.</p><p>In the hours after Buying Beverly Hills dropped on Nov. 4, Alexia reflected on Instagram about the <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>“wild ride” the filming process</a> had been. “This experience has taught me so much about myself and how to be a great agent,” she wrote. “Had to remind myself over and over that nobody is perfect! Hopefully a lot of you can learn from my mistakes, just as I did.”</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZputqZ67qHnBnq2eqpyueqm1y6WqZpmcmsWqrYyupJqmo6DGbq7Osp2roZWjsW61zayrmp%2Bilrputs6bZJuhnw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./california-sues-billionaire-vinod-khosla-over-beach-access.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>California Sues Billionaire Vinod Khosla Over Beach Access</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./malcolm-marie-star-zendaya-reveals-her-parents-made-up-her-name-what-it-means.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Malcolm &amp;amp; Marie' Star Zendaya Reveals Her Parents Made Up Her Name -- What It Means</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kristen-welker-and-john-hughes-still-together-updates.html>Are Kristen Welker and John Hughes Still Together?
