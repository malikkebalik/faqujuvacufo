He has pledged around 1/4 of his shares as collateral against lines of credit and personal debt. Since 2003, he has earned around $12 billion from Oracle stock sales and dividends.</p><p>Larry also owns roughly 1.5% of Tesla. A we detail in the next section below, Larry spent about $1 billion buying his Tesla stake over the course of 2018. At various points in recent years when Tesla has had a market cap of $1 trillion, that 1.5% stake was worth $15 billion.</p><p>Larry Ellison's net worth makes him one of the richest people in the world behind other tycoons like <a href=# title="Jeff Bezos Net Worth">Jeff Bezos</a>, <a href=#>Bill Gates</a>, <a href=#>Warren Buffett</a> and <a href=# title="Bernard Arnault Net Worth">Bernard Arnault</a>. For a brief period in the 1990s, Larry was the richest person on the planet when his net worth topped Bill Gates', as Microsoft stock slumped due to to the Department of Justice's antitrust investigation. During his years as CEO, Larry was consistently one of, if not the, highest paid executive in the world, regularly earning north of $90 million in some years as basic comp, not even including dividends or stock sales.</p><p>Larry took Oracle public on March 12, 1986. Coincidentally, that was one day before lifelong rival <a href=#>Bill Gates took Microsoft public</a>. At the time of the IPO Larry owned 39% of Oracle. By the end of the first day of trading, Oracle had a market cap of $270 million which meant that Larry ended the day with a paper net worth of $105.3 million. In 1990, Oracle found itself perilously close to bankruptcy. After losing more than 50% of its market cap, Oracle only had a few months of cash left in the bank. Larry, who had seen his personal net worth drop from around $500 million to $150 million was almost ousted from the company.</p><p>In June 2012 Larry paid $300 million for the Hawaiian island of Lanai.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-168027 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Larry-Ellison.jpg alt width=594 height=372 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-168027 class=wp-caption-text>Kimberly White/Getty Images</p><h2 id=tesla-investment><strong>Tesla Investment</strong></h2><p>Over a period of months in 2018, Larry Ellison quietly spent around $1 billion to acquire 3 million shares of Tesla.

He left the Tesla Board in August 2022.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Larry has been married four times and has two children. He was married to his most-recent wife, romance novelist Melanie Craft, from 2003 to 2010.

His primary residence is 45-acre estate in Woodside, California, that is likely worth at least $200 million. The mansion is modeled after a 16th century Japanese estate. It spans 45-acres and features a main house, a two-bedroom guest house, three cottages, a barn converted to a gym and a 3-acre man-made lake that features two waterfalls. After the local township assessed his property at a value of $173 million and handed Ellison the tax bill, he challenged the value and won, receiving a 60% tax cut on his "$70 million" property.</p><p>Between 2004 and 2005, Larry spent $180 million to acquire 12 properties in Malibu, California.

The longtime-California resident had be openly frustrated by ever-increasing taxes and other intrusions on businesses.</p><p>By uprooting from California to Florida, Larry was no longer on the hook for California's Franchise Tax Board 13% annual income tax rate. Over the last decade, Larry has received $1.7 billion in dividends from Oracle EVERY YEAR. By moving to Florida he saves $230 million in taxes just on those dividend payments alone. That works out to $644,000 in savings every single day of Florida residency. At that rate, Larry paid for the entire $80 million cost of his new Florida mansion after just FOUR MONTHS.</p><h2 id=gemini><strong>Gemini</strong></h2><p>In June of 2022, Larry was revealed to be the purchaser of a 16-acre estate near Palm Beach, Florida called Gemini. <a href=#>Larry paid $175 million for Gemini</a>. The seller, fellow billionaire tech entrepreneur <a href=# title="Jim Clark Net Worth">Jim Clark</a>, <a href=#>bought the home 15 months earlier for $94 million</a>.
