On August 5, 2023, law enforcement was summoned to the residence of Dr. Krystal Cascetta on two separate occasions before a tragic incident unfolded. Dr. Cascetta took the life of her 4-month-old daughter and subsequently ended her own life with a firearm.</p><p>At the time of the incident, Dr. Cascetta’s parents were in the residence. Around 7 a.m. on that Saturday, Dr. Cascetta entered her infant’s room, where she inflicted a fatal gunshot wound upon the child before turning the weapon upon herself, resulting in the loss of both lives.</p><p>The initial sound of gunfire prompted concern among residents, although it was dismissed as a possible accidental occurrence. Subsequent gunfire followed before bystanders could reach the room, causing them to become alarmed.</p><p>Upon their attempt to investigate, they encountered a locked door. After forcibly entering the room, the lifeless bodies of the doctor and her baby were discovered.</p><p>Neighbors recalled that both Krystal and her partner, Talty, had consistently exhibited friendly behavior, although they were notably private.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Tim Talty with wife Krystal Cascetta" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Tim-Talty-with-wife-Krystal-Cascetta.webp alt="Tim Talty with wife Krystal Cascetta" width=500 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>When did Tim Talty & Krystal Cascetta Get Married?</strong></h2><p>Tim Talty and Krystal Cascetta exchanged vows in a beautiful ceremony that took place in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, in 2019.
