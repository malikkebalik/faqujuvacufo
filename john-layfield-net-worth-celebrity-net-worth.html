In October 2001, Layfield won the WWF European Championship. After the WWF transitioned to WWE, John joined the hardcore division and won 17 WWE Hardcore Championships. He won the WWE Championship at The Great American Bash in June 2004, and his nine-month reign was the longest in a decade. In June 2006, John began working as a color commentator for "WWE SmackDown." He said on TheStreet.com that he was retiring from competition, and in his last column for the website, he wrote, "I have also come to believe that you can't fight father time. A broken back suffered in a match in England, compounded by a herniated and bulged disc, finally made me realize my career as a professional wrestler was over. I since migrated to the color commentary position much in the way that <a href=# title="Jesse Ventura Net Worth">Jesse Ventura</a> did before me." He occasionally returned to the ring after this, and he won the Intercontinental Championship in March 2009.

According to a 2017 "Sports Illustrated" article, Layfield "has been accused for years of being a locker room bully."

That year it was rumored that WWE commentator Mauro Ranallo left WWE because of hostilities with John. Ranallo later said that he and WWE "mutually agreed to part ways" and that Layfield had "nothing to do" with his departure. John released a statement that read, "Admittedly, I took part in locker room pranks that existed within the industry years ago. WWE addressed my behavior and I responded accordingly, yet my past is being brought up because of recent unfounded rumors. I apologize if anything I said playing 'the bad guy' on a TV show was misconstrued."</p><h2 id=championships-accomplishments><strong>Championships and Accomplishments</strong></h2><p>At Abilene Christian University, Layfield was named to the 1989 NCAA Division II Allâ€“American.
