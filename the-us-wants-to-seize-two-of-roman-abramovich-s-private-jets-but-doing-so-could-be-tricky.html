One of those oligarchs is <a href=#>Roman Abramovich</a>, who according to a report from the New York Times is in the sights of US officials who've made legal moves toward seizing two private jets allegedly owned by the billionaire.</p><p>Abramovich is alleged to have violated export regulations put in place in the wake of the war, and now a Boeing 787 Dreamliner and a Gulfstream jet reportedly worth a combined $400 million could be on the hook.</p><p>The US Bureau of Industry and Security alleges that Abramovich had the planes flown from the US to other countries shortly after the invasion of Ukraine without securing the proper licenses to do so, in violation of US regulations. The Dreamliner was flown to somewhere in Russia, according to legal filings, while the Gulfstream was sent to the United Arab Emirates. And the ownership of both aircraft were traced by the FBI through a complicated network of various shell companies up to Abramovich himself.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-333894 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-501990446.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-333894 class=wp-caption-text>Clive Mason/Getty Images</p><p>A judge has reportedly approved the FBI's request to seize the jets, although that process would obviously be a complicated and difficult one, considering that the planes are not even located within the United States.</p><p>But Michael J. Driscoll, Assistant Director of the FBI, seems determined to make it happen anyway. In a press statement, he spoke strongly about the need to hold figures like Abramovich to account:</p><p><strong>"These wealthy Russian oligarchs have helped foster an environment that enabled Russia to pursue its deadly war in Ukraine. The seizure of their valuable possessions, including these two aircraft, is just one way the U.S government holds accountable those who break U.S. laws and support Russia in its attempt to conquer a sovereign nation. Our work has only just begun and we won't back away."</strong></p><p>Abramovich has seen several consequences as a result of his Russian ties of late, including being forced to sell off Chelsea FC and seeing his assets in the European Union and UK frozen. He's also facing a fine of more than $300,000 from the U.S. Department of Commerce over his unlicensed transfer of the two planes, although such a fine doesn't mean much to even a beleaguered billionaire.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK7IpaOip56WtrOxjKecsKtfqbWmedSsZLCZnqnAbsDOZqqeoaqaerXDzmamn2WipLqiuoyamauZnaTDqq%2FHrGSpqpmrrrWxjKOcratdl8K1ecOooKefXai8bq%2FOrqOdZZKaerW%2ByJyismc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fila-is-thriving-and-the-man-who-helped-make-it-happen-is-worth-nearly-a-billion-dollars.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fila Is Thriving And The Man Who Helped Make It Happen Is Worth Nearly A Billion Dollars</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sylvester-stallone-selling-his-la-quinta-ca-home-for-3-35-million.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sylvester Stallone Selling His La Quinta CA Home For $3.35 Million</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kristen-welker-and-john-hughes-still-together-updates.html>Are Kristen Welker and John Hughes Still Together?
