His parents separated when he was three. He was raised by his mother in Macon, and during the summer he would spend time with his father in Homestead, Florida. Before his father went to his work, he would map out guitar chords on notebook paper to show his son where to place his fingers to play the chords and Jason would sit and practice all day while his dad was at work. When his dad got home, he got out his own guitar and they played together. Soon he could play a song after hearing it only a few times. His early favorites included George Strait's "The Cowboy Rides Away", Hank Williams Jr.'s "The Blues Man", and Alabama's "My Home's in Alabama".</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfn660u81mmKWclZa7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kollegah-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kollegah Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./don-rickles-net-worth-lifestyle-books.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Don Rickles Net Worth: Lifestyle &amp;amp; Books</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kristen-welker-and-john-hughes-still-together-updates.html>Are Kristen Welker and John Hughes Still Together?
