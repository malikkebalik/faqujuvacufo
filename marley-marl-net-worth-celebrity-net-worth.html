Marley Marl has a net worth of $5 million. He gained fame as a member of the hip hop producing collective the Juice Crew, and went on to release a number of studio albums. Marl is often credited with influencing such hip hop stars as RZA, Madlib, and <a href=# title="DJ Premier Net Worth">DJ Premier</a>.</p><h2 id=early-life-career-beginnings><strong>Early Life and Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>Marley Marl, whose real name is Marlon Williams, was born on September 30, 1962 in New York City, New York. He was raised in the Queensbridge housing projects in the borough of Queens. Early on, Marl performed in local talent shows. He soon developed an interest in electronica, and interned at Unique Recording Studios in the early 80s. During a studio session with an artist called Captain Rock, he discovered how to sample.</p><h2 id=juice-crew><strong>The Juice Crew</strong></h2><p>After experimenting around with sampling, Marl made a remix of Malcolm McLaren's 1982 hip hop single "Buffalo Gals." Impressed by what he heard, radio DJ Mr. Magic invited Marl to become his new sidekick on the radio show "Rapp Attack." The two went on to form the hip hop collective the Juice Crew in 1983. Comprised of mostly Queensbridge-based artists, the group included such members as <a href=# title="Big Daddy Kane Net Worth">Big Daddy Kane</a>, <a href=# title="Roxanne Shante Net Worth">Roxanne Shante</a>, <a href=# title="Kool G Rap Net Worth">Kool G Rap</a>, <a href=# title="Biz Markie Net Worth">Biz Markie</a>, <a href=# title="Masta Ace Net Worth">Masta Ace</a>, and <a href=# title="MC Shan Net Worth">MC Shan</a>.</p><p>The Juice Crew was known for producing "answer records" and engaging in various beefs with rival hip hop artists. Its breakout hit, 1984's "Roxanne's Revenge," was an attack on UTFO's song "Roxanne, Roxanne." Another successful record early on was "Marley Marl Scratch." In 1986, the label Cold Chillin' Records became home to the majority of the Juice Crew artists. At the label, Marl served as an in-house producer on many projects.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-213769 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Marley-Marl.jpg alt="Marley Marl Net Worth" width=394 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-213769 class=wp-caption-text>Scott Gries/Getty Images</p><h2 id=studio-albums><strong>Studio Albums</strong></h2><p>In 1988, Marl released his debut studio album, "In Control, Volume 1."

Nine years later, he released "Hip-Hop Dictionary." This was followed by "Re-Entry" in 2001, released on Barely Breaking Even Records. The album features appearances by Big Daddy Kane, Solo, Seven Shawn, J.
