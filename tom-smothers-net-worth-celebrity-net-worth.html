Tom Smothers is best known as one half of the musical comedy duo the Smothers Brothers, alongside his younger brother <a href=#>Dick Smothers</a>. In the late 1960s, the pair hosted the CBS television variety show "The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour," which featured such cutting critique of the political establishment that it led to the brothers' firing by CBS. After that, Tom and Dick continued to work on television, as well as in film and theater.</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>Tom Smothers III was born on February 2, 1937 in New York City to homemaker Ruth and US army officer Thomas. His younger brother is Dick, and he also has a younger sister named Sherry who was born after the family moved to California. In 1945, the kids' father died as a POW of the Japanese. As adolescents, Tom and Dick attended Redondo Union High School in Redondo Beach. There, Tom Smothers was a competitive unicyclist and a state champion gymnast on the parallel bars. With his brother, he went on to attend San Jose State College, where he did both gymnastics and track and field.</p><h2 id=smothers-brothers><strong>Smothers Brothers</strong></h2><p>Tom and Dick Smothers made their first professional appearance as a musical comedy duo in early 1959 at the Purple Onion cellar club in San Francisco. They soon became a popular act, releasing several successful albums and appearing on television variety shows, including "The Jack Paar Show" and "The <a href=# title="Judy Garland Net Worth">Judy Garland</a> Show." From 1965 to 1966, the Smothers Brothers starred on their own sitcom, "The Smothers Brothers Show," which lasted for one season on CBS. Tom felt that the program didn't play to his and Dick's strengths, and sought to have creative control over their next venture. That venture ended up being the CBS variety show "The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour," which debuted in early 1967. The show was a huge success with the youth demographic due to its audacious political satire, countercultural spirit, and showcasing of such popular music acts as Cream, the Who, Jefferson Airplane, <a href=# title="Pete Seeger Net Worth">Pete Seeger</a>, and the Doors. However, the show's forthright critique of the political establishment also proved controversial, raising the ire of CBS and the network censors. The controversy ultimately led to the cancellation of "The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour" in 1969, as well as the firing of the brothers from CBS. Tom and Dick subsequently filed a breach of contract suit against the network, and in 1973, after four years of litigation, won their case.</p><p>After "The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour" was canceled, the brothers starred in the hour-long 1970 special "The Return of the Smothers Brothers," which featured guests <a href=# title="Peter Fonda Net Worth">Peter Fonda</a> and <a href=# title="Glen Campbell Net Worth">Glen Campbell</a>. In 1975, the duo hosted the unsuccessful "The Smothers Brothers Show." Later, at the end of the 1980s, "The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour" was revived; however, it only lasted for one season. Tom and Dick stayed mostly active as a duo after that. In 2007, they filmed a series of commercials for the River Rock Casino in Geyserville, California, and in 2009 lent their voices to an episode of "The Simpsons." After an unofficial split in 2010, the Smothers Brothers reunited in 2019 to mark the 50th anniversary of the cancellation of the original "The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour." The duo later went on tour in 2023. Among their other endeavors, the Smothers Brothers own and operate the California vineyard and winery Remick Ridge Vineyards, which was established in 1977.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-251994 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/GettyImages-82938642.jpg alt width=594 height=407 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-251994 class=wp-caption-text>Getty Images</p><h2 id=film-career><strong>Film Career</strong></h2><p>Smothers has had some notable roles on the big screen. In 1972, he played corporate executive-turned-tap dancing magician Donald Beeman in <a href=# title="Brian De Palma Net Worth">Brian De Palma</a>'s comedy "Get to Know Your Rabbit." Later in the decade, Smothers played banker Donald Luckman in Ivan Passer's comedy crime thriller "Silver Bears." In 1980, he had a supporting role in "Serial" and the leading role in "There Goes the Bride." Smothers went on to star in the slasher parody film "Pandemonium," released in 1982. He was joined in the ensemble cast by <a href=# title="Carol Kane Net Worth">Carol Kane</a>, <a href=# title="Paul Reubens Net Worth">Paul Reubens</a>, Eve Arden, <a href=# title="Judge Reinhold Net Worth">Judge Reinhold</a>, and Eileen Brennan, among others.</p><h2 id=feud-with-bill-cosby><strong>Feud with Bill Cosby</strong></h2><p>Increasingly outspoken in his leftist politics, Smothers got into a feud in the 1970s with comedian <a href=#>Bill Cosby</a>, whom he felt did not take a strong enough stand on the day's political issues. In 1976, tensions between them came to a head during a party at the Playboy Mansion when Cosby punched Smothers in the head.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>With his wife Marcy Carriker, Smothers has two children named Bo and Riley. He also has a son named Thomas IV from his first marriage.</p><p>In 2023, Smothers announced in an interview that he had lung cancer, but that his prognosis was good.</p><h2 id=glen-ellen-mansion><strong>Glen Ellen Mansion</strong></h2><p>In May 2019 Tom put his 115-acre ranch in Glen Ellen, California up for sale for $13.5 million. He purchased the property in the early 1980s and in 1983 completed construction on a 6,000 square foot mansion. After several price chops, Tom finally sold this home in November 2023 for $7.2 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aKaoZ2jqXqku8yem6KZnqh8tbvMZqqmp6SdsrO%2FjKecrWWnpL%2B1tI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bosch-cast-reacts-to-co-star-annie-wersching-s-death.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Bosch' Cast Reacts to Co-Star Annie Wersching's Death</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./richard-grieco-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Richard Grieco Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kristen-welker-and-john-hughes-still-together-updates.html>Are Kristen Welker and John Hughes Still Together?
