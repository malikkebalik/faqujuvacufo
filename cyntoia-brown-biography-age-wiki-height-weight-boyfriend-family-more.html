Brown was charged with one count of premeditated murder, one count of murder, and one count of armed robbery after being arrested.</p><p>She was just 16 years old at the time, but she was put on trial as an adult. She denied being a prostitute in an interview, as well as having sex with Allen. She said, however, that she shot him in self-defense. She said Allen attempted to reach the firearm while the two were lying in bed together, and she shot him with her own weapon in self-defense.</p><p>According to the spot in which Allen’s body was found, investigators suspect he was asleep when he was shot. This evidence bolstered the prosecution’s case that Brown’s crime was motivated by the desire to rob Allen.</p><p>After getting released from prison, Brown married her boyfriend and American musician J.
