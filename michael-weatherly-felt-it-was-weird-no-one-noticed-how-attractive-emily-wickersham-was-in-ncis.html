The long-running procedural would cast Wickersham as agent Eleanor Bishop in season 11. At the time, she was well aware that a few might see her as an attempt to replace De Pablo’s Ziva David. This added to her nerves, but most&nbsp;NCIS&nbsp;fans warmly welcomed Wickersham.</p><p id=par-3_34>“People were very attached to Ziva,” she told&nbsp;Watch&nbsp;(via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Post</a>). “I wasn’t replacing her, but it was scary to come into that. People are crazy about the show. [We] have such wonderful fans.”</p><p id=par-4_64>Wickerhsam’s character was married in the television show. And Weatherly was asked in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TV Line</a> if this was a good thing. When De Pablo was still a part of the show, there was a lot of romantic tension between <a href=#>her character and Weatherly’s</a>. With agent Bishop being married, the idea was that Weatherly wouldn’t have the same dynamic with Wickersham’s character.</p><p id=par-5_12>But Weatherly felt Bishop’s relationship status didn’t really matter in that regard.</p><p id=par-6_101>“And I don’t know how happily married she can possibly be; she’s always with us,” Weatherly said. “I would say one of the weirdest things about the whole season is that nobody seems to have noticed that she’s attractive. And I don’t mean Tony, I mean&nbsp;nobody. I think they were between a rock and a hard place bringing her in because they didn’t want her to be romantic in any way with anyone, yet they hired a beautiful woman. I think the producers and writers and actors, we’ve all been working to figure out, ‘How does the Bishop character work best?'”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-did-emily-wickersham-end-up-on-ncis>How did Emily Wickersham end up on ‘NCIS’?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_29>Wickersham already had a <a href=#>few credits to her name</a> before doing&nbsp;NCIS. She recalled one of her first roles was on&nbsp;The Sopranos, which turned her into a fan of acting.</p><p id=par-8_22>“After being on&nbsp;The Sopranos, I was totally hooked and just wanted to do more and more,” she once told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Chic Spy</a>.</p><p id=par-9_10>From there, Wickersham managed to get on&nbsp;NCIS&nbsp;through the traditional way.</p><p id=par-10_61>“My manager and agents set me up for an audition for the role of Bishop. I auditioned, was called back, and then actually acted out some of the scenes with [Mark Harmon] and other cast members. I remember getting the call that I got the part; it was pretty incredible. Then it was a matter of keeping the job,” she said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-did-emily-wickersham-leave-ncis>Why did Emily Wickersham leave ‘NCIS’?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-11_25><a href=#>Wickersham left&nbsp;NCIS&nbsp;in 2021</a>. She delivered a post on her social media reflecting back on her journey in the series and complimenting the cast and crew.</p><p id=par-12_52>“Hangin’ this hat and jacket up. What a great ride it’s been,” she posted according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>. “This cast, this crew, are top notch. I can’t say enough kind words about this group that I’ve had the pleasure of working with for close to 8 years now and 172 episodes later.”</p><p id=par-13_23>She also expressed her gratitude for being on the show, and it seemed that she decided to leave the show on her own.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-14_70>“This business is finicky and weird, and consistency is a rarity. I’ve been lucky enough to be a part of a show where I got to show up and act and laugh and learn with wonderful people,” Wickersham continued. “A moment in time I surely won’t forget. Thank you, CBS and NCIS, for including me in a part of television history. Time goes fast. Eat it up but chew slowly.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6qq%2FHmpylZaearrW0xKujsmWWmrm1edaeoKucXaO8brvNnmSnp6SesKawjJqrraqRmMGqwsRmnKahnK56uLXCpJyrq5iWum66wqKqZ6Ckorlw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shyne-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shyne Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fran-tarkenton-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fran Tarkenton Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kristen-welker-and-john-hughes-still-together-updates.html>Are Kristen Welker and John Hughes Still Together?
