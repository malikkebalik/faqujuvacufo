If you’ve been on the fence about investing in at-home orthodontics, you’ll want to take a read:</p><h2>What Are the Benefits of At-Home Teeth Straightening Kits?</h2><p>There are plenty of benefits of at-home dental kits, making them an appealing alternative to more traditional orthodontics — especially if you’re just trying to correct a small issue or make up for the fact that you didn’t wear a retainer after having orthodontic work as a child.</p><p>Here are some of the major benefits that make ordering an at-home teeth straightening kit appealing for certain cases and scenarios:</p><p><strong>It’s much less expensive than traditional orthodontics:</strong> “The main pro of DIY aligners is the cost factor,” says Kashmira Patel, Medical Researcher at the Farr Institute. “Visiting your dentist less frequently during treatment cuts down the cost significantly.”</p><p><strong>Everything is shipped straight to your door:</strong> Most at-home teeth straightening kits are developed and shipped out directly to the consumer. “The aligners are conveniently delivered to you when you are required to change them which makes adjustment days much less of a hassle,” says Patel.</p><p><strong>The process offers expedited results:</strong> According to Patel, most at-home teeth straightening kits actually work faster than traditional orthodontics. “They are reported to show the desired effects faster than aligners that require dental visits,” she explains.</p><h2>What Do You Need to Consider?</h2><p>The reasons that some people choose at-home straightening kits comes down to convenience and cost. However, according to Anthony Terrana, Board Certified Orthodontist, there are many cons to at-home straightening to consider.</p><p>Here are a few major setbacks that might make you want to re-think at-home straightening kits depending on your specific needs and situation:</p><p><strong>It could cause tooth loss:</strong> Many patients have underlying medical conditions such as periodontal disease, explains Dr. Terrana. “Without proper x-rays and diagnosis from a professionally licensed practitioner, treating cases with underlying periodontal disease with at-home teeth straightening kits can actually lead to tooth loss.”</p><p><strong>It might cause TMJ:</strong> Additionally, orthodontics is more than just simply aligning teeth. More important is bite correction. “Simply aligning teeth without proper bite correction can lead to TMJ issues down the road,” explains Dr. Terrana. “At-home straightening kits do not address the bite in any way.”</p><p><strong>Real tooth movement isn’t truly feasible:</strong> According to Dr. Terrana, these types of at-home teeth straightening kits do not come with proper tooth attachments that are commonly used in clear aligner treatment. “Without proper attachments on teeth, most tooth movements are not feasible,” he says.</p><p><strong>It could make your bite even worse:</strong> “We have many patients who experimented with at-home aligner kits, whose teeth and bites have worsened, and then had to come in and pay for a second round of treatment,” says Dr. Terrana. “In the short term patients think they will save money using at-home straightening kits, but combined with usually needing a second round of proper orthodontic treatment, it ends up costing more.”</p><p><strong>You must be extremely disciplined:</strong> What’s more, do-it-yourself aligners only work well only if you’re very disciplined. You have to wear them for the prescribed time during the day and night (at least 22 hours per day) for the best results. “Because there is no regular scheduled time with the orthodontist/dentist to check on your progress, the chances of not completing the prescribed treatment are quite high,” adds Patel.</p><h2>What Are the Top-Rated At-Home Teeth Straightening Kits?</h2><p>Interested in finding out more about at-home teeth straightening kits? If you’re hoping to correct a small issue or make up for years of neglecting your retainer, an at-home kit might still do the job — but if you’re working with a bite issue or significantly misaligned teeth you might want to speak directly to an orthodontist before moving forward.</p><p>Below, we’ve rounded up some of the most well-respected and top-rated brands that might be worth considering if you’re looking for a simple way to straighten your teeth without the cost and commitment of a more traditional orthodontic treatment:</p><h3>Smile Direct Club</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/luna-askmen-images.askmen.com/deals/health_deals/askmen_article_embed.png><span class=articleImgCrd>Smile Direct Club</span><p>Smile Direct Club has the most name recognition when it comes to at-home straightening kits and continues to be one of the most well-loved. The company pairs you with an orthodontist who tracks your journey remotely and also offers a ton of freebies like teeth whitening tools and toothbrushes.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> “I LOVE my new smile.
