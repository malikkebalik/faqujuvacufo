But the recent episode put them in a grey area. Here is what it could mean.</p><p id=par-2_17><strong>[Spoiler alert: This article contains spoilers from</strong> <strong>the Grey’s Anatomy episode “Everyday is a Holiday (With You).”]</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-amelia-and-link-reunited-on-grey-s-anatomy>Amelia and Link reunited on ‘Grey’s Anatomy’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-1 readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/GreysABC/status/1461525117767409668</p></figure><p id=par-3_56>Amelia and Link broke up earlier in the season because he wanted to get married, and she didn’t. The mother later revealed to <a href=#>Addison Montgomery</a> (Kate Walsh) that Link loved domestic life and taking care of Meredith’s (Ellen Pompeo) kids during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. But she struggled to stay sober with all of the pressure.</p><p id=par-4_41>The episode ended with Addison telling Amelia she could regret making a decision to break up at a time she was struggling with her mental health. But Amelia said it’s kind to Link go since they want different things in life.</p><p id=par-5_53>“Everyday is a Holiday (With You)” showed Amelia and Link preparing Thanksgiving dinner for Meredith’s kids and their son. They know they need to figure out how to co-parent for Scout, so spending the day together makes sense. Meredith is no longer able to make it, so it’s just them for the holiday.</p><p id=par-6_19>The episode ends with the kids asleep and the dinner being successful. <a href=#>Amelia and Link</a> have a private conversation.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-amelia-and-link-hooked-up-but-what-did-her-words-before-it-mean>Amelia and Link hooked up but what did her words before it mean?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Greys-Anatomy-Amelia-Link.jpg><p id=par-7_39>Amelia tells Link, “You are nothing like your parents.” He kisses her, and she seems to be OK with that. But she pulls away and says, “Nothing has changed for me.” Link seems unsure but decides to keep going.</p><p id=par-8_42>This could be taken in different ways. Amelia could mean that she still loves him, which is believable given their history and that they share their child. It could also mean that if they have sex, then they’ll still be broken up.</p><p id=par-9_35>The episode also started with <a href=#>Dr. Kai Bartley</a> (E. R. Fightmaster pronouns they/them) texting Amelia. They sent pictures from the lab, and Amelia looked thrilled to get them. This could be foreshadowing a love triangle.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-will-amelia-link-and-kai-bartley-be-in-a-love-triangle>Will Amelia, Link, and Kai Bartley be in a love triangle?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3 readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/GreysABC/status/1460669023167856645</p></figure><p id=par-10_18>Amelia met Kai in Minnesota. They are working together with Meredith to find a cure for Parkinson’s disease.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_38>It looks like Kai and Amelia immediately had chemistry. In the last episode, they asked each other if they’re single. Kai playfully said they were married…to the lab. It looks like Amelia was disappointed at first, then happy.</p><p id=par-12_31>Right now, it looks like Amelia is more interested in Kai, but circumstances could change. Her last words on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ABC show</a> in the episode left a little room for interpretation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS0s7HYrGSappGpvK7FjJqknqSZlnqttc2kZKGnn6CypXnUqWSbraRisaqwjLCmq5yjYq%2Bmss6rnGallZa7b7TTpqNo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cast-members-who-have-tragically-died.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cast Members Who Have Tragically Died</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./video-of-monica-and-her-mom-rhoslc-fighting.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Video of Monica and Her Mom RHOSLC Fighting</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kristen-welker-and-john-hughes-still-together-updates.html>Are Kristen Welker and John Hughes Still Together?
