But that doesn’t mean she was born into massive wealth. Her grandfather and great-grandfather were masons who actually built the stone walls and laid the foundations at her weekend property.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-3_52>After she graduated, Dorinda moved to New York and was working in the Liz Claiborne showrooms when she met and married her first husband Ralph Lynch. They eventually moved to London, where Dorinda founded and ran the DCL cashmere company and dressed famous clients like Princess Diana and Dynasty star Joan Collins.</p><h2>Her net worth may surprise some ‘RHONY’ fans</h2><p id=par-4_46>When Dorinda and Ralph split in 2005, she sold DCL Cashmere and moved back to New York with her daughter Hannah. It wasn’t long before she met and married her second husband Dr. Richard Medley, a successful hedge fund manager and business partner of George Soros.</p><p id=par-5_47>When they married, Richard gave Dorinda the house she dreamt about as a child — Blue Stone Manor — as a wedding present. He paid $2.115 million for Dorinda’s dream home, then she teamed up with her friend and interior designer Marshall Watson to renovate the property.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_56>The Medleys were married for six years, until Richard passed away in 2011 at the age of 60 from liver failure. Since his death, Dorinda has continued to lean into her entrepreneurial spirit and work on new projects. She also joined the cast of RHONY, where she earned an annual salary of $250,000 for six seasons.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_21>Between her business success and her two husbands, Dorinda now has a current net worth of $20 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Distractify</a>.</p><h2 id=h-dorinda-medley-has-a-number-of-money-making-ventures-in-the-works>Dorinda Medley has a number of money-making ventures in the works</h2><p id=par-8_54>Dorinda left Real Housewives of New York in 2020 when <a href=#>Bravo</a> put her on “pause.” But she returned to the franchise this year for Real Housewives Ultimate Girl Trip: Ex-Wives Edition. She wrote a book titled Make It Nice, but many of her current money-making ventures are centered around her beloved <a href=#>Blue Stone Manor</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_49>Dorinda has always been “very careful” about her branding. And when she thought about what she wanted to do post-RHONY, she says she found inspiration from her late husband, Richard, and her weekend home. In 2020, Dorinda said she was creating a cookbook based on her Berkshires home cooking.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-10_29>“I’m thinking about publishing a great Blue Stone Manor cookbook. It’s a Betty Crocker kind of theme. Easy to do, at your fingertips, old school, you know?” Dorinda said.</p><p id=par-11_21>She also created <a href=#>Blue Stone Manor bourbon</a> because Richard was a bourbon drinker, and her weekend home was once a speakeasy.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_21>Fans can catch up with Dorinda Medley on Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip: Ex-Wives Club, which is now streaming on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxsL7Ip5uaZZ2asa2x2Kxkp52kYsSwvtOhZKaZqWLAtr7Pq6CsnV2ovK6xjKufqKapYrOiutJnn62lnGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nancy-ajram-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nancy Ajram Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./colin-farrell-net-worth-movies-lifestyle.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Colin Farrell Net Worth: Movies &amp;amp; Lifestyle</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kristen-welker-and-john-hughes-still-together-updates.html>Are Kristen Welker and John Hughes Still Together?
