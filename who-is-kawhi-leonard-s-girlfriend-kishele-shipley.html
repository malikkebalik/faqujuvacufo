She has a degree in Public Administration.</p><p id=par-4_107><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="According to the school's website (opens in a new tab)" href=#>According to the school’s website</a>, “Effective leadership and competence in the administration of public affairs are needed more urgently today than ever before in the nation’s history. The growth of all levels of government and public service organizations and their increasing responsibilities in a complex society have led directly to the need for more capable public administrators. The primary purpose of the Public Administration major at SDSU is to provide knowledge and skills for students who wish to prepare themselves for management careers in government and community agencies and to instill in students the necessary analytical tools to develop and evaluate programs and policies in public administration.”</p><p id=par-5_27>After graduation, Shipley worked as a Human Resources professional in San Diego before moving to Texas with Leonard when he signed with the San Antonio Spurs.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Shipley prefers to stay out of the spotlight</h2><p id=par-6_31>Shipley was born on April 10, 1989, to parents Cathy Marie Shipley and Kenneth Shipley. She has two siblings — an older sister, Kenisha, and a younger sister, Kasandra.</p><p id=par-7_75>Like Leonard, Shipley is a very private person and prefers to keep out of the limelight. She doesn’t have any public Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram accounts. Both Kenisha and Kasandra are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="active on social media (opens in a new tab)" href=#>active on social media</a> but they respect their sister and Leonard’s privacy and do not post anything about the pair. Because of this, there aren’t many photos of Leonard’s lady online but was spotted last season cheering him on at Raptors home games.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" id=emb-2 readability=4><p>https://twitter.com/TheRenderMedia/status/1137204324755529728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1137204324755529728&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fheavy.com%2Fsports%2F2019%2F06%2Fkawhi-leonard-wife%2F</p></figure><p id=par-8_38>In fact, the two are so private there is some confusion about their marital status. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="In a 2016 interview (opens in a new tab)" href=#>In a 2016 interview</a>, ESPN referred to Shipley as Leonard’s “fiancée.” However, it has never been confirmed if they ever got engaged.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The couple has one child together</h2><p id=par-9_12>There have also been conflicting reports about how many children they have.</p><p id=par-10_19>We know Leonard and Shipley have one daughter together named<br>Kaliyah Leonard, who they welcomed in 2016.</p><p id=par-11_93>Back in April 2019, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Narcity reported (opens in a new tab)" href=#>Narcity reported</a> that Shipley gave birth to a baby boy at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto. Raptors fans flooded social media to express how delighted they were over the news that the couple’s son would be a Canadian citizen since he was born in that country. But the reports that they had another child were not confirmed either and during a June 2019 interview, Leonard talked about things he enjoys doing off the court like hanging out with his daughter. However, he did not mention anything about a son.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-12_44>“Once I do other stuff, you might see me interact a little bit more, tell jokes, laugh,” Leonard said. “You’ll see the things I like to do other than just playing basketball like fishing, going golfing, or just hang out with my daughter.”</p><p id=par-13_18>Read more: <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="How Long Have Steph and Ayesha Curry Been Married and How Many Children Do They Have?
