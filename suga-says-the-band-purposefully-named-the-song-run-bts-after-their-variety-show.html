All of the songs on Proof take up three CDs, and each CD includes a new song by the band.</p><p id=par-3_28>The second CD includes a new song called “Run BTS.” While it is not the lead single, “Run BTS” has quickly become a favorite song of ARMY.</p><p id=par-4_33>Speaking with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Weverse Magazine</a>,&nbsp;Suga explained what it was like for BTS to make the song “Run BTS.” Suga revealed the song got its name from BTS’ variety show, Run BTS, which began in 2015.</p><p id=par-5_58>“It’s a little bit different emotionally. ‘Born Singer’ made me emotional—it’s got a fair bit of emotion in it. For ‘Run BTS,’ we kept saying we wanted to try doing a song in our older style, so we chose a title that both shares its name with our variety show and reflects who we are—always running,” said Suga.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-run-bts-feels-like-a-past-bts-song>‘Run BTS’ feels like a past BTS song</h2><p id=par-6_28><i>S</i>onically, “Run BTS” feels like it could be on an older BTS album even though it is a new song, as it embraces BTS’ past hip-hop sound.</p><p id=par-7_14>In his Weverse Magazine interview, Suga explained more about the making of “Run BTS.”</p><p id=par-8_56>“All the members have come a long way, and there’s times when we’re exhausted but there’s also things we want to do moving forward, so I think we tried to include those desires as well. And I really didn’t have many opportunities to show off my rap skills on our recent albums,” the BTS rapper said.</p><p id=par-9_53>He continued, “So it made me think of the past, which made me want to write something a little tighter, but rapping it was really difficult. (laughs) We got it recorded quickly, but it had been a long time for me, so I really had to work at it when we were recording.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-suga-wants-people-to-be-excited-about-his-music>Suga wants people to be ‘excited’ about his music</h2><p id=par-10_25>Following the release of Proof, BTS announced that they will be focusing on solo music as individuals instead of releasing music as a septet.</p><p id=par-11_23>With this temporary shift in focus, Suga told Weverse Magazine he hopes fans will be “excited” about what he releases in the future.</p><p id=par-12_82>“Some people are going to be excited for the day my music comes out and for me to perform. There aren’t a lot of things to be excited for in life. But for anyone who likes my music, I hope they’re excited for it—excited for when it comes out, excited for when I promote and excited for when I go on tour. I hope they’re excited for everything so I can give their life meaning each and every day,” the rapper said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvtb%2BMrKygmV2orrq%2FjJuYp5xdpcKzvM6snJ%2BtnKHGbrrAppydZaOku6h50a6lZpqkqHqistOeqWasmJq2s3nVmqminaSuerS0zrBloaydoXw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./a-million-little-things-season-5-cast-departures-and-returning-characters.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>A Million Little Things Season 5 Cast Departures and Returning Characters</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./molly-shannon-bra-size-age-weight-height-measurements.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Molly Shannon Bra Size, Age, Weight, Height, Measurements</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kristen-welker-and-john-hughes-still-together-updates.html>Are Kristen Welker and John Hughes Still Together?
