There seems to be no end to Musk’s reign of terror as Twitter gets worse and plunges itself even further down the proverbial toilet. Perhaps the only smart decision that Musk has made was banning former-president Donald Trump from Twitter, but considering that Musk <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reinstated him shortly after</a>, it wasn’t much of a breakthrough.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=699 data-current-count=699 data-injectable=true>But who could Elon Musk possibly be gunning for this time? Well, it’s an unlikely enemy, but Musk is banning furries from Twitter. That’s right, no one is safe. In the past, without repercussions, self-proclaimed furry @SoatokDhole has commented on Twitter’s regulations and security, essentially exercising his right to free speech. Elon Musk, who’s as power-hungry as they come, obviously preaches that free speech is important, but then bashes anyone who dares oppose his rules. In a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>, @SoatokDhole — as he was previously known on Twitter before the ban — details the ordeal of how he was suspended not long after Musk’s wave of suspending journalists.</p><p data-characters=702 data-current-count=702 data-injectable=true>As @SoatokDhole states, Musk claims to be a “free speech” absolutist, insisting that he promotes Twitter as a platform for anyone and everyone to speak out about what ails them. It’s always been “free speech” this and “free speech in America” that, but Musk never delivers on that promise — like always. Yesterday, Dec. 15, Musk banned the @ElonJet Twitter account,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">after explicitly promising not to</a>. But it wasn’t just that. They also blocked Twitter users from linking to the @ElonJet account on Mastodon. The reason that @SoatokDhole was suspended is that he found a way to bypass the rule that prohibits posting a link to ElonJet on Mastodon.</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>In his closing comments, @SoatokDhole mentions that you can find him on Mastodon at&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@<span class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=deadb1bfaab1b59eb8abacaca7f0bbb0b9b7b0bbbbac>[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> and that “[he] [doesn’t] intend to rejoin Twitter, even if [his] suspension is reversed.” Shortly after he published the blog post, Twitter’s UI updated to inform him that his account suspension would be permanent.</p><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=556 data-injectable=true>Furries — and furry supporters — all over Twitter were outraged to learn about the unwarranted suspension. In fact, @SoatokDhole has been called “one of the most notable furs in cryptography.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>the guy who paid 44bn usd to be kicked in the balls 24/7 has suspended one of the most notable furs in cryptography <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/FvrtLUYHlE</a></p>— ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ ⋌( #ACAB! #BLM! ) 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏳️‍⚧️ (@maffsie) <a href=#>December 16, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=103 data-current-count=403 data-injectable=true>Likewise, Boozy Badger, one of the most significant furry lawyers in history, weighed in on the drama.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>I survived the Thursday Night Tantrum.
