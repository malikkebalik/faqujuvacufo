The trio quite literally grew up together on the set of the <a href=#>Harry Potter</a> movies. The actors were children when they nabbed the roles of Hermione Granger, Harry Potter, and Ron Weasley. However, by the time they filmed and promoted the eight flicks, they were well into adulthood. But what was it like for the stars to spend a decade of their lives together, and what kind of relationship do they have today?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Rupert-Grint-Daniel-Radcliffe-and-Emma-Watson.jpg><h2 id=h-emma-watson-revealed-that-rupert-grint-and-daniel-radcliffe-were-like-brothers-to-her>Emma Watson revealed that Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe were like brothers to her</h2><p id=par-2_86>Watson has been candid about the fact that she developed a familial relationship with both Grint and Radcliffe. <a href=#>The Perks of Being a Wallflower star </a>spent so much time with her Harry Potter castmates that she thought of them as her brothers. This sibling connection was actually what made it so difficult for Watson to kiss them in the last two movies. Watson called smooching both Radcliffe and Grint awkward and admitted that she wanted to get it over with as quickly as humanly possible.</p><h2>Are the ‘Harry Potter’ stars still in contact today?</h2><p id=par-3_69>But what is the relationship between the trio like today? Are they still in touch now that they’re no longer promoting and shooting the Harry Potter movies? In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vogue</a>, Watson revealed that she, Radcliffe, and Grint actually don’t have a group chat together. But, there’s a very good reason for that, and they still find ways to keep in contact and offer each other support.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_99>“They both hate WhatsApp and their phones in general,” Watson shared about Grint and Radcliffe. “Actually, as a three, we really try and stay off electronics so that doesn’t help for a massive amount of back and forth. We aren’t on a group chat, but we speak individually. Rupert sends me pictures of [his daughter] Wednesday, and I die. Dan and I generally try and calm each other’s nerves. We both mainly try and stay out of the limelight, so it’s been nice to have each other’s support, knowing there was going to be another wave of attention coming.”</p><h2>Why Watson tries to stay off of electronics</h2><p id=par-5_43>It actually makes a lot of sense that Grint, Radcliffe, and Watson don’t have a group text. This is especially true since Watson’s phone is usually dead anyway. In an&nbsp;interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">British Vogue</a>, Watson explained why her cellphones are typically without a charge.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_54>“I have one, my work phone, and I have a personal phone,” <a href=#>the Noah actor</a> shared. “Both of them are usually dead. This is a strategy of mine. It’s kind of how I deal with how stressful life can be. It does drive people around me a bit mad, but I do my best.”</p><p id=par-7_49>Given how much attention the Harry Potter stars have received over the years, it makes sense that they do everything they can to live a private and peaceful lifestyle. However, we’re sure fans are pleased that Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint have managed to find ways to keep in touch.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSyrrnAZq6arKOku263xJ6nrGWkpMKktIydmKehlaF6s63DnKOinpaaerPBz56prWWXp7avwI2hq6akXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./john-doerr-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>John Doerr Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./david-villar-stats-scouting-report-college-baseball-mlb-draft-prospects.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>David Villar Stats &amp;amp; Scouting Report College Baseball, MLB Draft, Prospects</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kristen-welker-and-john-hughes-still-together-updates.html>Are Kristen Welker and John Hughes Still Together?
