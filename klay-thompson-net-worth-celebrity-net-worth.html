The very next day, he scored a career-best 41 points in a win over the Los Angeles Lakers. He topped this in January of 2015, scoring 52 points with 11 three-pointers in a victory over the Sacramento Kings.

Moreover, he posted the highest scoring output by any Golden State Warriors player in over 42 years. The team ultimately made it to their third consecutive NBA Finals, once again facing the Cavaliers and taking their second championship in three years.

The next season, Thompson signed a five-year, $190 million maximum contract to stay with the Warriors. He then underwent surgery to repair his ACL, causing him to miss the entire 2019-20 season. Thompson also missed the entirety of the 2020-21 season due to an Achilles injury.</p><h2 id=world-cup-olympics><strong>World Cup and Olympics</strong></h2><p>Beyond the NBA, Thompson has had a successful US national team basketball career.
