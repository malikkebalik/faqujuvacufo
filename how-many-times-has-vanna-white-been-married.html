Because when something like that happens, you immediately think you’re the only one.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-white-has-two-children-with-her-ex-husband>White has two children with her ex-husband</h2><p id=par-6_31>White was married one time.

A week after revealing the news on Wheel of Fortune she had a miscarriage. “Obviously I lost the baby, which was devastating after announcing it,” White said. “The good news is I was able to get pregnant again and had two beautiful, healthy children. … But losing a child — there’s nothing good about that.”</p><p id=par-8_23>White and Santo Pietro’s son, Nicholas&nbsp;“Nikko” Santo Pietro, was born in 1994.
