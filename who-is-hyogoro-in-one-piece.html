Oden, a member of the Kozuki Family, admired Hyogoro from a young age. However, when Oden was 15, there was an incident called the Harem Revolt, and Hyogoro and his yakuza group got involved.</p><figure class=image contenteditable=false>Still from the anime.</figure><p dir=ltr>Around 41 years ago, Hyogoro's followers informed him that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kin'emon</a> had stolen their money. Hyogoro understood that facing Kin'emon in a one-on-one battle wouldn't end well for his subordinates. He also witnessed Oden defeating the Mountain God, which left a strong impression on him.</p><p dir=ltr>Around 20 years ago, tragedy struck. Hyogoro was captured, and his wife and comrades were killed because they refused to submit to the shogun, Kurozumi Orochi. He was then handed over to the Beasts Pirates and imprisoned in Udon's Prisoner Mine.</p><h3 dir=ltr id=hyogoro-in-one-piece-9>Wano Country Arc</h3><p dir=ltr>In the Prisoner Mines, Hyogoro was subjected to harsh labor, including moving large blocks of rock. One day, after his hard work, he went to collect his meager ration of kibi dango and was disappointed to receive only one piece. When he complained, a guard struck him, leaving him injured. The deputy warden, Dobon, arrived and further mistreated Hyogoro by stepping on him.</p><p dir=ltr>However, things took a turn for the better when two fellow prisoners, Monkey D. Luffy and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eustass Kid</a>, stood up to the guards. Luffy rescued Hyogoro from his predicament by carrying him on his shoulder.</p><p dir=ltr>Grateful for Luffy's assistance, Hyogoro thanked him the next day. In a kind gesture, Luffy shared some of his meal tickets with Hyogoro.</p><figure class=image contenteditable=false>Still from the anime.</figure><p dir=ltr>Trouble arose again when guards became suspicious of Hyogoro having extra meal tickets and attacked him. Hyogoro refused to give up his beloved dango, even in the face of danger. Luffy intervened to protect him from Daifugo, one of the guards, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Queen</a>, the headliner of the Beasts Pirates, who sentenced them both to fight in the Sumo Inferno.</p><p dir=ltr>In the Sumo Inferno, Hyogoro and Luffy were made to wear collars that would decapitate them if they left the ring. They were allowed to remove their handcuffs for combat. As they faced off against various opponents, Luffy displayed his mastery of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Haoshoku Haki</a>, stunning his adversaries into unconsciousness. Hyogoro observed Luffy's abilities in awe and was intrigued when Luffy mentioned Silvers <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rayleigh</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>In their battle against Alpacaman and Madilloman, Hyogoro's skills came to the forefront. With Luffy's guidance, he demonstrated an advanced Busoshoku Haki technique, swiftly defeating Alpacaman.</p><p dir=ltr>Hyogoro attempted to teach Luffy the advanced techniques of Busoshoku Haki, but Luffy continued to defeat opponents using his own methods without grasping the concept. As time passed and the others in the prison rested, Hyogoro questioned Luffy's motivations for wanting to defeat <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaido</a>. It was during this conversation that Raizo arrived to explain the situation. Hyogoro was astonished to learn that the Nine Red Scabbards, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Momonosuke</a>, and their allies were all alive.</p><p dir=ltr>This revelation renewed his determination to fight against Kaido and Orochi. He expressed his desire to join their alliance and shared information about potential allies locked in the prison.</p><figure class=image contenteditable=false>Still from the anime.</figure><p dir=ltr>During the night, Hyogoro and Luffy indulged in stolen oshiruko, but their overindulgence caused them to gain weight. The next day, as they prepared for their next matches in the Sumo Inferno, Queen activated the Picture Tanishi, broadcasting the execution of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shimotsuki Yasuie</a>. Hyogoro explained the effects of the SMILE fruits to Luffy, and they watched as Luffy's crewmates caused a ruckus at the execution site.</p><p dir=ltr>Subsequently, Hyogoro witnessed the arrival of Kamazo, who turned out to be Kid's crewmate, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Killer</a>. It was revealed that Killer had fallen victim to a defective SMILE fruit.</p><p dir=ltr>Big Mom's unexpected entrance into the prison surprised Hyogoro, who was unfamiliar with her. He was even more surprised when she effortlessly defeated Queen. When Big Mom sought oshiruko and clashed with Luffy, she inadvertently pushed them out of the ring. Luffy managed to remove their collars, and Hyogoro faced Big Mom, hoping Luffy would grow stronger by facing her.</p><p dir=ltr>Hyogoro noticed that Luffy's actions surpassed what he had been trying to teach him. He believed that Luffy's newfound skills in Busoshoku Haki would protect him from Big Mom. However, Big Mom swiftly sent them crashing into a wall. Luffy pulled Hyogoro out of the wall, and Hyogoro revealed that he had used Haki to shield himself. He continued to impart knowledge about advanced Busoshoku Haki techniques to Luffy before Big Mom pursued them throughout the Prisoner Mines.</p><figure class=image contenteditable=false>Still from the anime.</figure><p dir=ltr>Following Queen's successful capture of Big Mom and her removal from the Prisoner Mines, Hyogoro observed Luffy's resilience in the face of adversity as he battled the Beasts Pirates. He admired Luffy's determination and was pleased to witness his victory over Warden Babanuki. When Raizo, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kawamatsu</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kikunojo</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chopper</a> joined their group, Hyogoro instructed Kikunojo and Raizo to reveal themselves to rally the prisoners.</p><p dir=ltr>As the battle against the Beasts Pirates escalated, they found themselves cornered by prisoners infected with the Mummy virus. Hyogoro was astonished when Luffy managed to persuade these prisoners to rebel against their captors. He continued to fight alongside Luffy and his allies during the prison takeover.</p><p dir=ltr>When the liberated prisoners expressed skepticism upon learning that Luffy was a pirate, Hyogoro attempted to reassure them. He noticed Luffy's growing trust among the prisoners, and he emphasized the importance of having a goal to unite them. Hyogoro was also reacquainted with the four yakuza bosses imprisoned in Udon, defending Luffy when they confronted him.</p><p dir=ltr>As the Fire Festival approached, Hyogoro oversaw Luffy's training in Busoshoku Haki. He received Yasuie's final message and communicated with Kin'emon, who instructed everyone to prepare for the upcoming raid on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Onigashima</a>. Hyogoro informed his fellow rebels in Udon about Cho bringing weapons from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ringo</a>.</p><figure class=image contenteditable=false>Still from the anime.</figure><p dir=ltr>On the day of the Fire Festival, the rebels gathered at Habu Port, where they joined forces with the Scabbards. Hyogoro took charge of the samurai and participated in their discussions on infiltrating Onigashima.</p><p dir=ltr>Upon reaching Onigashima, the rebels received disguises from Kin'emon's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Devil Fruit</a> abilities. Hyogoro joined <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Denjiro</a> in the southern forces as they prepared for the impending battle against the Beasts Pirates.</p><p dir=ltr>Following the division of Denjiro's forces into two groups, Hyogoro and a team of rebels infiltrated the Performance Stage within the Skull Dome. There, they discovered Momonosuke crucified and patiently awaited the opportune moment to strike.</p><p dir=ltr>As the chaos unfolded during the battle, with Kaido disposing of Orochi and various factions aligning themselves with the Beasts Pirates, Hyogoro was appalled by the betrayal of the Orochi Oniwabanshu and Mimawarigumi, who abandoned their warrior pride for self-preservation. When the Scabbards and Izou initiated a surprise attack on Kaido, Hyogoro, and the rebels revealed themselves, joining the all-out war against the Beasts Pirates.</p><p dir=ltr>As the fierce battle intensified, Hyogoro and the yakuza leaders made it their mission to confront the Tobiroppo, expressing confidence in the alliance's chances of victory. Observing Luffy's use of Gear Fourth to battle Goki, Hyogoro commented on Luffy's resemblance to a Wisdom King.</p><p dir=ltr>When Queen unleashed the Ice Oni virus, leading to Omasa's infection and intention to take his own life, Hyogoro intervened to prevent the suicide. As Chopper began producing the antidote, the yakuza bosses volunteered to protect him. In the midst of the struggle, Hyogoro himself contracted the Ice Oni virus, but it transformed him into his prime physical state.</p><figure class=image contenteditable=false>Still from the anime.</figure><p dir=ltr>As the battle raged on, Hyogoro confronted and defeated the Mimawarigumi, even as his Ice Oni infection worsened. Recognizing that he was on the brink of transforming into an ice oni, he commanded Yatappe to end his life. However, Chopper intervened, preventing Yatappe from carrying out the order and successfully administering the antidote. Hyogoro's condition was reversed, and he returned to his shorter stature. He internally apologized to Chopper for mistakenly referring to him as a "tanuki."</p><p dir=ltr>Following Kaido's announcement of Luffy and the Scabbards' defeat, Hyogoro grew anxious. Still, Momonosuke conveyed Luffy's message, reinvigorating the Alliance's resolve. As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoro</a> engaged in a battle with King, Hyogoro and Kawamatsu noted resemblances between Zoro and members of the Shimotsuki Family, specifically Ushimaru and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryuma</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>Amidst the unfolding chaos on the Performance Floor, Hyogoro witnessed a colossal dragon soaring overhead, with Luffy hanging from one of its horns. He was further shocked as Queen detached his neck and tail from his body. When Big Mom faced defeat at the hands of Kid and Law, causing a powerful quake to ripple through Onigashima, everyone on the Performance Floor was physically shaken.</p><p dir=ltr>When it appeared that Kaido had defeated Luffy on the rooftop, Hyogoro sensed that Luffy was still alive. After the Raid on Onigashima concluded, he participated in the celebration of Wano's liberation, joining fellow Yakuza in the festivities.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2b7%2FPqKmtq5uasqWtjZympmefo7JuvMiemp5nmK68qLvRqGSipl2ku6Z5z6KcnJ0%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bitcoin-millionaire-jeff-garzik-has-given-away-more-than-100m-has-no-regrets.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bitcoin Millionaire Jeff Garzik Has Given Away More Than $100M, Has &amp;quot;No Regrets&amp;quot;</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sergei-bobrovsky-weight-loss-before-and-after-pics-health-update-and-age.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sergei Bobrovsky Weight Loss, Before And After Pics Health Update And Age</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kristen-welker-and-john-hughes-still-together-updates.html>Are Kristen Welker and John Hughes Still Together?
