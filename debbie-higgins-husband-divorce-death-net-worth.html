Since its air in 2002, Dr Phil has accomplished many things. But today we will be talking about his former wife<strong>, Debbie Higgins</strong>, the lesser-known past of Dr Phil.</p><p>To make it clear, we will be talking about Debbie and her husband’s relationships, her career, and her life after the divorce. Don’t forget to read the article to know the complete information on her. Let’s get started.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/debbie-0002.jpg><p>But first some facts.</p><h2>Debbie Higgins: Quick Facts</h2><table class=facts><tbody><tr><th>Full Name:</th><td>Deborah Higgins McCall</td></tr><tr><th>Age:</th><td>63 years</td></tr><tr><th>Birth Date:</th><td>1950</td></tr><tr><th>Ethnicity:</th><td>White</td></tr><tr><th>Nationality:</th><td>American</td></tr><tr><th>Marital Status:</th><td>Married</td></tr><tr><th>Spouse:</th><td>Tony Burasco</td></tr><tr><th>Children:</th><td>4</td></tr><tr><th>Died:</th><td>September 14, 2014</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Early Life and Education</h2><p>The former wife of Dr Phil, Debbie Higgins, originally named <strong>Deborah Higgins McCall,</strong> was born in Kansas City, Missouri, the United States of America. She is American by nationality and belongs to white ethnicity.</p><p>Similarly, she was the daughter of a mother, <strong>Georgia Swartz,</strong> while her father’s name is unknown. Also, Debbie had two siblings, a sister named <strong>Linda Craft</strong> and a brother names <strong>Bill Higgins</strong>.</p><p>As for her education, there is not much information to this date.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Bill Haast Cause Of Death: How Did He Die?>></strong></a></p><h2>Age, Height, and Measurements</h2><p>Debbie was born in the year 1950, which means she turned 63 years old this year. Since she was always secretive about her life, her exact date of birth is unknown to the public. Not to mention, even her star sign is also in the dark.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Keyara Stone Bio- Age, Height, Net Worth, Career, Boyfriend, Instagram >></a></h4><p>Moreover, her measurements, including her weight and height, were also undisclosed. But she did have long blonde hair and stunning blue eyes.</p><h2>Personal Life: First Wife of Dr Phil- Marriage and Divorce</h2><p>As mentioned above, Deborah or Debbie was the first wife of Dr Phil. So how did their relationship start? It all began when they were just in their college. When they first met, both of them were only 20 years old.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, from their first encounter, they felt an attraction and decided to marry. Their wedding ceremony took place on November 27, 1970, at Roseland Park, Kansas, USA, and was attended by their friends and family.</p><p>However, their marriage got worse as the days passed. Phil suddenly got violent towards Debbie and confined her to house and household chores. He did not even allow Higgins to go out without his assistance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/debbie-0003.jpg><p>As if it was not enough for Higgins, Phil even started going out with other women and openly confessed when asked. Also, he stated it was normal for him to date other women. Unable to keep up with the infidelities and behavior of Phil, Higgins chose to split. And finally, in 1973, the couple split and went their ways.</p><p>Soon after the divorce, Phil started dating<strong> Robin Jo Jameson</strong> and eventually married her in 1976. They now have two children together and are still living together. Moreover, it seems Higgins also went and married <strong>Tony Burasco.</strong> With him, Debbie had four children; a son, <strong>Jeff,</strong> and a daughter, <strong>Marci.&nbsp;</strong></p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel Cook Model, Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend, IG >></a></h4><p>She also had stepchildren named <strong>David</strong> and<strong> Kim.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>Debbie Higgins: Is She Dead?- Cause of Death</h2><p>After the divorce, Debbie chose to stay away from the media and limelight. Similarly, she stayed away from the public until Higgins was disclosed as an editor of the documentary “Christy Mathewson’s Day” in 2011. Debbie was also a part of the 2013 horror film Demon Hunters: Fear of Silence.&nbsp;</p><p>As the public was getting a bit of information on Debbie, her brother suddenly dropped the shocking news the next year. He informed that Debbie passed away after she lost a long battle to cancer. Likewise, Higgins died on September 14, 2014, at the age of 63.&nbsp;</p><p>Any further details regarding her death have not been disclosed to the public yet.</p><h2>Net Worth and Income</h2><p>Since Higgins stayed away from the public, not much has been known about her career. This also includes information regarding her assets and income. However, Higgins’s net worth was estimated to be around<strong> $1 million at the time of her death.&nbsp;</strong></p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daisy Cryer Bio- Age, Height, Siblings, Career, Net Worth, Parents >></a></h4><p>Meanwhile, her former husband, Dr Phil, has a staggering net worth of<strong> $400 million</strong> as of 2019.
