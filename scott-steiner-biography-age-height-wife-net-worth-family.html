Steiner and Drake went on to win the tag team titles. A few weeks later, Steiner and Drake retained the Impact World Tag Team Championships in a rematch against LAX. On the May 17, 2018, episode of Impact Wrestling , Steiner and Drake lost the Impact World Tag Team Championships to <a href=#>Andrew Everett</a> and DJZ. On the May 31, 2018, episode of Impact Wrestling: Under Pressure, Steiner was defeated by his former partner Eli Drake ending their partnership following their title loss. On the January 11, 2019, episode of Impact Wrestling, Steiner made a special return during Scarlett Bordeaux's Smoke Show segment attacking The Desi Hit Squad. On the August 2, 2019, Unbreakable event, he teamed up with <a href=#>Petey Williams</a> and <a href=#>Jordynne Grace</a></p><p>On April 23, 2017, Steiner returned to TNA, now known as Impact Wrestling aligning himself with <a href=#>Josh Mathews</a>. On July 2, 2017, at Slammiversary XV Steiner returned to action teaming with <a href=#>Josh Mathews</a> in a losing effort to Joseph Park and <a href=#>Jeremy Borash</a>.</p><p>On June 7, 2015, Steiner was pinned by Rob Van Dam at Citi Field`s Legends of Wrestling show. After the match Steiner and Doc Gallows attacked RVD leading to Bill Goldberg coming to the aid of Van Dam and spearing Steiner.</p><p>Rechsteiner was banned from attending the 2015 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony after Hogan's wife accused him of accosting her at a San Jose airport. Hogan's wife alleged that he threatened to kill Hogan, and the couple subsequently reported the incident to police. Rechsteiner denies making the death threat.</p><p>Following his departure from TNA, Steiner began performing for various European promotions on a European tour. On May 31, 2013, the Steiner Brothers won the Preston City Wrestling Tag Team Championship before losing it the following day. On June 2, Steiner won the Dutch Pro Wrestling Heavyweight Championship. On June 23, the Steiner Brothers defeated Eddie Kingston and Homicide at the House of Hardcore 2 event.</p><p>After three months of inactivity, Rechsteiner was released from TNA in March 2012.</p><p>Following his departure from TNA, Rechsteiner began expressing his disdain with TNA management via Twitter, specifically Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff. As a result, he was contacted by TNA's attorneys. After he continued making similar remarks, TNA filed a legal complaint against him in June 2012. He responded by filing a countersuit against TNA on September 10, claiming he was owed royalties. It was reported in November that a second lawsuit was filed by Rechsteiner, claiming he was injured as a result of TNA officials such as Hogan allowing Jeff Hardy to wrestle him while intoxicated. TNA's lawsuit against Rechsteiner was dismissed by a judge in February 2016.</p><p>On the January 27, 2011 episode of Impact! (taped January 12), Steiner returned to TNA as a face, saving Kurt Angle, Matt Morgan, and Crimson from Fortune and Immortal. The next week, Fortune turned on Immortal and aligned themselves with Steiner, Angle and Crimson. On February 13, at Against All Odds, Steiner, James Storm and Robert Roode defeated Immortal members <a href=#>Rob Terry</a>, Gunner and Murphy in a six-man tag match. Steiner pinned Gunner after the Frankensteiner. Steiner then began feuding with <a href=#>Rob Terry</a> after Terry attacked him on the February 24 Impact!, during a "posedown" between the two. The following week, Steiner defeated Terry in a singles match.</p><p>On February 4, 2010, Steiner's profile was removed from TNA's official website. His departure from the company was confirmed the following week.</p><p>Steiner joined the Puerto Rican promotion World Wrestling Council (WWC) in March 2010, debuting in an angle where he attacked Universal Heavyweight Champion Ray GonzÃ¡lez. On April 3, at Camino a la Gloria 2010, Steiner wrestled his first match for WWC, losing to GonzÃ¡lez in a championship match. On April 24, he defeated GonzÃ¡lez in a rematch to become the new Universal Heavyweight Champion. On May 29, he was stripped of the title, after a defense against GonzÃ¡lez ended in a no contest. On July 11, GonzÃ¡lez defeated Steiner (in a match refereed by Ricky Banderas) to regain the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship.</p><p>In 2010, Steiner defeated Brutus Beefcake to become Canadian Wrestling International (CWI)'s first Heavyweight Champion in Caledonia, Ontario. He retained the title in matches against Kevin Nash and <a href=#>Big Van Vader</a>.</p><p>At Sacrifice 2008, before his match against Samoa Joe and Kurt Angle, Steiner cut a promo talking about his chances of winning. This promo is remembered because the numbers Steiner gave and the non-sense of the maths. His "Steiner Math" promo has been parioded several times by wrestlers and other people not related with pro wrestling.</p><p>On February 8, 2007, Steiner returned as NWA World Heavyweight Champion Christian Cage's "special consultant", in Cage's match with Kurt Angle at Against All Odds, interfering to cost Angle the match and joining Christian's Coalition. Steiner eliminated Angle in a gauntlet match to determine a number one contender, then lost to him at Destination X. At Lockdown, Steiner was part of Team Cage, which lost to Team Angle in a Lethal Lockdown match.</p><p>At a TNA house show in San Juan on June 3, 2007, Rechsteiner was kicked in the throat by his opponent, Apolo. After he began coughing up blood, he was taken by ambulance to a hospital, where he was diagnosed with a torn trachea and given five hours to live. He was put in an induced coma for two days, while doctors cut through his ribs and lung to repair the tear, then began draining fluid from his lungs for the next two weeks. Unable to fly because the change in air pressure would have caused his lung to collapse, he eventually left on a cruise ship and arrived in mainland U.S. one week later.</p><p>On March 11, 2006, the Steiner Brothers defeated Eddie Venom & <a href=#>Elvis Elliot</a> at a UCW wrestling show in Bay City, Michigan.</p><p>On June 2, 2006, the Steiner Brothers defeated <a href=#>Elvis Elliot</a> & Original Sinn (Sinn Bodhi) at a UCW wrestling show at Bay City Western High School in Auburn, Michigan entitled "Steiner Brothers Return Home."</p><p>Steiner debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) at Destination X 2006, before making his Impact! debut on March 18, identifying himself as Jeff Jarrett's bodyguard. In subsequent weeks, he attacked TNA wrestlers and staff, demanding to be hired.</p><p>Rechsteiner underwent foot surgery in July 2004, having six screws inserted into his foot, a tendon transplant, and a bone graft. He then convalesced in a cast for eight months. <a href=#>Scott Steiner</a> returned to the ring on August 28, 2005, in Asheville, North Carolina for the independent promotion, Universal Championship Wrestling, teaming with his brother Rick in 2006. On June 10, 2006 they defeated Disco Inferno and <a href=#>Jeff Lewis</a>. He wrestled briefly in LAW, alongside <a href=#>Buff Bagwell</a>, and feuded with the tag team Fame and Fortune.</p><p>In December 2005, Rechsteiner, Lex Luger, and <a href=#>Buff Bagwell</a> were removed from a flight from Minneapolis to Winnipeg following a disturbance on board the plane. They were detained for several hours before Rechsteiner and Bagwell were released and permitted to continue on their journey; Luger, however, was held without bail and later charged and jailed. Rechsteiner would later refer to the incident during his in-character interviews, describing himself as a violent criminal with little regard for the forces of law and order.</p><p>On April 14, Steiner faced off against Nowinski in a debate over the Iraq War. Later that year, Steiner formed a tag team with Test, with Stacy Keibler as their manager. The team lasted several months, and feuded with La RÃ©sistance. They broke up after Test turned heel and began misogynistically treating Keibler. On June 15, Steiner defeated Test in a grudge match to win the managerial services of Keibler at Bad Blood, but lost her back to Test in a rematch on the August 18 episode of Raw. At Unforgiven on September 21, Steiner faced Test with Keibler's managerial services again on the line with the extra stipulation that, if Steiner lost, he would become Test's manservant. Steiner lost after Keibler's interference backfired, and the tag team was reunited at Test's behest. After another mistake by Keibler cost the team a match on the September 29 episode of Raw, Steiner belly to belly suplexed her, resulting in Steiner turning heel and teaming on better terms with Test as Keibler was forced to remain their reluctant manager. On December 1, Mick Foley fired in storyline Steiner and Test freeing Stacy as their manager. His last WWE match was as a part of the 2004 Royal Rumble, lasting over 6 minutes before being eliminated by Booker T. Steiner suffered an injury in 2004, sidelining him for two months. While injured, he was released from WWE on August 17, 2004.</p><p>On Raw in January 2003 Steiner began feuding with World Heavyweight Champion Triple H, and his faction Evolution. They began competing against one another for strength and muscle conditioning leading to world title matches at the Royal Rumble and No Way Out. Steiner won the first match by disqualification after Triple H attacked him with a sledgehammer, but lost the second match at No Way Out via pinfall. Both matches were not well received by fans with the first going on to win the Wrestling Observer Newsletter's "Worst Worked Match" award.</p><p>After his contract with AOL-Time Warner expired in November 2001, Rechsteiner joined the World Wrestling All-Stars, where he was reunited with his former WCW valet Midajah. He appeared at WWA house shows in Europe and Australia throughout 2001 and 2002. At the third WWA pay-per-view, The Eruption, on April 12, 2002 at the Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne, Steiner challenged Nathan Jones for the WWA World Heavyweight Championship. Despite the presence of WWA Commissioner Sid at ringside, Steiner was able to cheat his way to victory, striking Jones with the title belt and making Jones submit with the Steiner Recliner. Steiner held the belt for several months (although never defending it) before vacating it in November 2002, and leaving WWA for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Before joining WWE, Steiner teamed with his brother Rick to defeat Hiroshi Tanahashi and Kensuke Sasaki on May 2, 2002 in Japan, on New Japan Pro-Wrestling's 30th Anniversary show.</p><p>In October 2002, Rechsteiner signed a three-year contract with World Wrestling Entertainment, and returned to WWE television after an eight-year absence at Survivor Series in Madison Square Garden on November 17. There, <a href=#>Scott Steiner</a> attacked Matt Hardy and <a href=#>Christopher Nowinski</a> after they delivered a promo insulting New York City, establishing him as a face.</p><p>Rechsteiner appeared in the television program Charmed on February 1, 2001, playing "Mega Man" in the episode "Wrestling With Demons," alongside fellow WCW wrestlers Booker T and <a href=#>Buff Bagwell</a>. He also appeared in the Disney Channel program The Jersey as himself. Steiner also plays the role of Boss in the 2017 Indian Comedy-Drama: 1 Chor 2 Mastikhor.</p><p>After the nWo disbanded again, Steiner joined The Millionaire's Club in their feud with Vince Russo and Eric Bischoff's New Blood stable, turning face for a brief time. At Spring Stampede, he competed in a tournament for the United States Championship, defeating The Wall by disqualification when he blinded him, which caused Wall to accidentally chokeslam the referee through a table instead. He then defeated Mike Awesome by submission with his finisher, the Steiner Recliner before ultimately winning the tournament after defeating Sting in the finals, albeit due to interference from Sting's previous opponent Vampiro. Steiner would also feud with <a href=#>Tank Abbott</a> and his brother, a now-heel Rick. Steiner would turn heel again on former nWo teammate Kevin Nash at Bash at the Beach by helping Goldberg defeat him in a match where fellow nWo alumnus Scott Hall's contract was on the line, joining the New Blood in the process. On November 26, 2000 at Mayhem, Steiner defeated Booker T to win the World Heavyweight Championship, becoming a Triple Crown Champion in the process. In January 2001, Steiner became the centerpiece of Ric Flair's Magnificent Seven stable. He feuded with Booker T over several months and pay-per-views until losing the World Heavyweight Championship back to him on the final episode of Nitro on March 26, 2001. After WCW was purchased by the WWF, Rechsteiner, unlike many of his colleagues, did not join the WWF and instead opted to wait until his contract with AOL Time Warner expired later that year before seeking other opportunities.</p><p>Rechsteiner has been married to Christa Podsedly since June 7, 2000. They have two children and reside in Detroit.</p><p>In 1999, Steiner feuded with Goldberg, Diamond Dallas Page, Booker T, and Rey Mysterio, Jr., and won the United States Heavyweight Championship and World Television Championship. In late 1999, he was sidelined with a back injury and stripped of the United States Heavyweight Title. On a December 1999 episode of Nitro, Steiner cut a promo to announce his retirement from professional wrestling due to this injury. Later that evening, he revealed himself to, in fact, be in fine health, turning on and attacking Sid Vicious. He continued to be a top heel into 2000 and joined the reformed nWo.</p><p>On February 22, 1998, Steiner joined the nWo at SuperBrawl VIII, by attacking his brother Rick while they were defending the WCW World Tag Team Championship against The Outsiders. The next night, on Nitro, he adopted a new gimmick, dyeing his hair and beard blond and further increasing his muscle mass. Scott then adopted the nicknames "White Thunder", in reference to his bleached hair and goatee and his all-white singlet, and "Superstar", as a homage to "Superstar" Billy Graham. However, he soon discarded both nicknames, and instead proclaimed himself as "Big Poppa Pump". Steiner further altered his attire as he began wearing sunglasses and chain mail headgear as part of his ring entrance outfit. He then began teaming with former rival <a href=#>Buff Bagwell</a> and remained a member of the nWo until the group disbanded in early 1999.</p><p>On April 21, 1998, in Cherokee County, Georgia, Rechsteiner threatened Georgia Department of Transportation employee Paul Kaspereen after Kaspereen informed him that an exit ramp leading off Interstate 575 was closed. He then hit Kaspereen twice with his Ford F-250 pickup truck. Kaspereen was not badly hurt. Rechsteiner was subsequently arrested and pleaded guilty on March 17, 1999 to aggravated assault and making terroristic threats, both of which are felonies carrying a maximum sentence of 30 years imprisonment. Under Georgia's first-offender rules, which stipulate that a first-time offender will be found not guilty if they do not violate the terms of their probation, Judge C. <a href=#>Michael Roach</a> sentenced Rechsteiner to 10 days in Cherokee County Jail. He also placed Rechsteiner on seven years' probation; ordered him to pay $25,000 in fines, restitution, and legal fees; and made him perform 200 hours of community service.</p><p>The Steiner Brothers rejoined WCW in 1996. They won the World Tag Team Championship from Harlem Heat on July 24, but proceeded to lose it back to them just three days later. After the formation of the New World Order (nWo), the Steiner Brothers feuded with The Outsiders, who had won the World Tag Team Championship from Harlem Heat. This feud lasted from 1996 to early 1998. At the same time, the Steiners also feuded with other nWo members like Vicious and Delicious and continued to have matches with Harlem Heat. From late 1997 into early 1998, Steiner underwent noticeable physical changes, such as massively increasing his muscle mass, cutting his signature mullet and growing a goatee. During this period, Steiner began feuding with nWo member <a href=#>Buff Bagwell</a> over who had the better physique. Before long, he began leaving Rick in the ring by himself during tag team matches, or starting the match without ever tagging his brother in.</p><p>On July 28, 1995, The Steiner Brothers debuted in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), at The Orange County Fairgrounds in Middletown, New York, defeating <a href=#>Dudley Dudley</a> and Vampire Warrior. On August 4, in The Flagstaff in Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, they defeated <a href=#>Dudley Dudley</a> and 2 Cold Scorpio. They made their ECW Arena debut on August 5, at Wrestlepalooza, teaming with Eddie Guerrero to lose to Scorpio, Dean Malenko, and Cactus Jack. On August 25, in Jim Thorpe, they defeated Scorpio and Malenko, and defeated Scorpio and Chris Benoit the following evening. On August 28, they defeated <a href=#>Dudley Dudley</a> and Dances with Dudley in the Big Apple Dinner Theater in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania. At Gangstas Paradise on September 16, they teamed with Taz and lost to The Eliminators (John Kronus and Perry Saturn) and Jason. On September 23, in Middletown, they defeated Raven and Stevie Richards. <a href=#>Scott Steiner</a> made his final ECW appearance on October 28, teaming with Taz and losing to The Eliminators.</p><p>On the September 13 episode of Raw in New York, New York, The Steiner Brothers defended the title against The Quebecers (Jacques and Pierre) in a "Province of Quebec Rules" match, wherein the title could change hands via disqualification. The match ended when the manager of The Quebecers, Johnny Polo, threw a hockey stick into the ring and Scott caught it. When the referee saw Scott holding the foreign object, he disqualified The Steiner Brothers and awarded the title to The Quebecers. Scott defeated Pierre in a singles match the following week on Raw. Steiner competed in the elimination match main event of Survivor Series, marking his only headlining WWF pay-per-view appearance. On January 22, 1994, <a href=#>Scott Steiner</a> was the first entrant in the Royal Rumble. After nine minutes, he was eliminated by Diesel. Following this, the Steiner Brothers left the WWF in mid-1994.</p><p>In 1994 after leaving WWF they returned to Japan as full time workers until he end of 1995.</p><p>Steiner appeared in numerous WCW video games, including WCW: The Main Event (1994), WCW SuperBrawl Wrestling (1994), WCW vs. The World (1997), WCW vs. nWo: World Tour (1997), WCW Nitro (1998), WCW/nWo Revenge (1998), WCW/nWo Thunder (1999), WCW Mayhem (1999), and WCW Backstage Assault (2000). He also appeared in the WWE video game Here Comes the Pain, and WWE 2K14 as a downloadable character in his nWo attire. Steiner was also playable in the only home console released TNA game, TNA Impact!, released in 2008.</p><p>WWF talent relation officials Pat Patterson, and <a href=#>Bruce Prichard</a> were enamored with <a href=#>Scott Steiner</a> and pitched an idea to Vince McMahon for Scott to come in as a surprise entry into the Royal Rumble in 1993 and win the event, then moving on to win the world championship at WrestleMania 9. However Vince was not keen to the idea and both the Steiners themselves voiced their desire to remain as a tag team, therefore Vince began booking them as such. The Steiner Brothers made their WWF television debut with a promo on the December 21, 1992 episode of Prime Time Wrestling. They appeared on the debut episode of Raw on January 11, 1993. Their pay-per-view debut came on January 24, at the 1993 Royal Rumble, where they defeated The Beverly Brothers (Blake and Beau). At WrestleMania IX on April 4, The Steiner Brothers defeated The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu).</p><p>In 1990, Steiner began wrestling in singles matches. WCW's weekend TBS shows (Power Hour, Saturday Night, and Main Event), featured the NWA/WCW Gauntlet Series, in which a wrestler was selected to face a different top star on each show that weekend, winning $10,000 if they defeated all three. Steiner was the first to successfully "run the gauntlet" from September 21â€“23, defeating Bobby Eaton, Ric Flair and Arn Anderson. On January 30, 1991, Steiner had a WCW World Heavyweight Championship match against Flair at Clash of the Champions XIV: Dixie Dynamite, which ended in a time limit draw. In late 1992 the Steiners temporarily disbanded when Rick suffered a torn pectoral muscle. Scott then started wrestling single matches, and then later teased a heel turn when he teamed with <a href=#>Marcus Bagwell</a> against Steve Austin and Brian Pillman on an October 10, 1992 episode of WCW Worldwide. During the match Bagwell was injured when he was attacked Arn Anderson and when Steiner went to tag Bagwell he was unable to. An angry Steiner then kicked Bagwell and slammed him into the ring where he was attacked by Austin and Pillman who then won the match. Shortly after he won the WCW World Television Championship on October 17, 1992. Steiner later vacated the title when The Steiner Brothers left WCW for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) that November, after a contract dispute with WCW Executive Vice President Bill Watts.</p><p>In 1991, the Steiners worked for New Japan Pro Wrestling while under contact with WCW and WWF. On March 21, 1991 they defeated <a href=#>Hiroshi Hase</a> and Kensuke Sasaki for the IWGP Tag Team Championship. They dropped the titles to Hase and Keiji Muto on November 5. Then On June 26, 1992 they defeated <a href=#>Big Van Vader</a> and Bam Bam Bigelow for the titles. They dropped them to Scott Norton and <a href=#>Tony Halme</a> on November 22. During their time in WWF they only did a few matches.</p><p>Rechsteiner's weight gain in the late 1990s led to allegations of steroid abuse, which he denied. He claims that it was training from professional wrestling legend, "The Body Guy" Nick Golfis. Upon returning to WWE in late 2002, he was asked to undergo a steroid test, and agreed on the condition that Triple H take one as well; he claims that WWE did not follow through with either test.</p><p>In 1988, Rechsteiner joined the Memphis-based Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) under his real name. He formed a tag team with Billy Joe Travis, and defeated the Cuban Choir Boys for the CWA World Tag Team Championship on May 29. On June 6, they lost the title to <a href=#>Gary Young</a> and Don Bass. Rechsteiner and Travis regained the title on June 27, and lost it to The Rock 'n' Roll RPMs (Mike Davis and Tommy Lane) on August 15. Rechsteiner formed a new tag team with Jed Grundy, and on February 18, 1989, they dethroned CWA World Tag Team Champions Robert Fuller and <a href=#>Jimmy Golden</a>. Rechsteiner's third and final CWA reign ended on February 25, when Fuller and Golden regained the title. He left the CWA soon after.</p><p>Rechsteiner, under the ring name <a href=#>Scott Steiner</a>, debuted in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) during a backstage interview at Chi-Town Rumble, later accompanying his brother Rick to the ring as he lost the NWA World Television Championship to <a href=#>Mike Rotunda</a>.
