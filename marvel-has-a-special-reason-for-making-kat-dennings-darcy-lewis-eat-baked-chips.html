Dennings is not giving insight into how she has helped mold her character for the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wandavision-katdennings-disneyplus-darcylewis.jpg><h2 id=h-how-does-darcy-lewis-come-into-the-world-of-wandavision>How does Darcy Lewis come into the world of ‘WandaVision?’</h2><p id=par-2_42>Dennings reprised her role of Darcy Lewis for WandaVision after being absent from the Marvel universe since the sequel to Thor back in 2013. Darcy was last seen as an assistant to Jane Foster, played in the movies by Natalie Portman.</p><p id=par-3_45>“I’m so grateful to the writers for giving her this rich backstory because the last time we saw her, she was Jane Foster’s intern, and the joke was that she’s a political science major and not a science major,” Dennings told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TVLine</a> about her character.</p><p id=par-4_38>In the Disney+ show, Darcy comes in as part of the S.W.O.R.D group that is studying the magnetic activity coming from the town of Westview. Dennings added that she loves how her character is influenced by Jane Forster.</p><p id=par-5_43>“It’s really fun to see that [the] influence Jane Foster had on her results in her actually becoming an astrophysicist… She’s the same girl, but now she has a bunch of degrees and a bunch of information. She’s a boss now,” Dennings added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/katdennings-wandavision.jpeg><h2 id=h-kat-dennings-helps-mold-darcy-lewis>Kat Dennings helps mold Darcy Lewis</h2><p id=par-6_38>As the character of Darcy helps bridge the film and TV universe of Marvel, Dennings has been able to mold her character. Many fans noticed that Darcy was still eating junk food but this time, she elevated it.</p><p id=par-7_38>“They wanted to keep Darcy’s essence. At heart, she’s still that college girl who eats trash ramen from 7-Eleven like me. And I really love that they put that in there,” Dennings explained in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>.</p><p id=par-8_31>Writers and producers have asked Dennings for their input on their character she’s portraying. They asked the 2 Broke Girls alum what flavor of Cup of Noddles she liked the best.</p><p id=par-9_35>“Then they asked what kind of potato chips do you think Darcy would eat,” Dennings further explained. “I was like, ‘Well, she’s an adult now so maybe the baked ones.’ I love those little things.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><h2 id=h-kat-dennings-was-blindsided-by-darcy-s-return>Kat Dennings was blindsided by Darcy’s return</h2><p id=par-10_39>After completing her run on the Thor sequel, Dennings wasn’t aware that her character would be back. Darcy didn’t appear in any other film, so when she got a call, she was taken aback and was sworn to secrecy.</p><p id=par-11_46>“Once you’re in the Marvel Universe, you’re kind of there even if they kill you. You’re still there,” Dennings told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>. “A lot of time had gone by between the first two Thor movies and I didn’t know whether or not they’d ever bring Darcy back.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wandavision-katdennings-disneyplus.jpeg><p id=par-12_47>“I never assumed that they would so when I got this call, especially for this, because Darcy has [had] nothing to do with Wanda or Vision, or the Avengers other than Thor, it was kind of like, “What is she doing here?” And that was my question.”</p><p id=par-13_49>Dennings went on to explain she got a secret phone call and had to sign a [Non-Disclosure Agreement] to get that call. Although the actress says she doesn’t know a lot about what’s going in with the show or her character, she knows she’s “in for a wild ride.”</p><p id=par-14_5>WandaVision airs weekly on Disney+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEorrDmq2iq5mku265wKutnqRdna60ecBmqqmdk56urXnRnpisp55is7C%2BjKaYpKGenHqsrdNmm56mnp67qL%2BMnZirm6liuabDyKxknpmkYq%2Bit8SdZJygmaXAb7TTpqNo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./modern-family-star-ariel-winter-celebrates-costar-nolan-gould-s-21st-birthday-at-tao-see.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Modern Family Star Ariel Winter Celebrates Costar Nolan Goulds 21st Birthday at TAO See</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./father-alain-chicoine-mother-family.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Father Alain Chicoine, Mother Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kristen-welker-and-john-hughes-still-together-updates.html>Are Kristen Welker and John Hughes Still Together?
